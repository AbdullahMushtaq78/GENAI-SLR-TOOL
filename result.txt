The studies included both qualitative and quantitative research, providing a comprehensive view of AI's impact on medical training and readiness among healthcare professionals.\n\n#### Key Findings\n1. **Innovative Educational Approaches**:\n   - **Virtual Patient Simulations**: One study demonstrated that first-year medical students improved their understanding of clinical complexities through interactions with AI-driven virtual patients (Truong et al., 2022). This method provided a safe environment for students to practice diagnostic skills without the risks associated with real patients.\n   - **Integrated Learning Environments**: Another study highlighted the effectiveness of combining virtual and face-to-face simulations to enhance clinical judgment among healthcare students (Seo et al., 2023). This hybrid approach allowed for a more immersive learning experience, addressing the limitations of traditional educational methods.\n   - **Conversational AI in Training**: The use of conversational AI in training nursing students was shown to create diverse and interactive learning scenarios, significantly improving their preparedness for real-world clinical challenges (Seo et al., 2023).\n\n2. **AI in Clinical Practice**:\n   - **Diagnostic Tools**: AI tools, such as the Ex-DBC system, were found to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer diagnoses, reducing unnecessary biopsies (Chen & Wang, 2023). This application not only aids in clinical decision-making but also serves as a teaching tool for medical students.\n   - **Automated Assessments**: Studies indicated that AI could streamline complex procedures, such as the automated assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, allowing non-specialists to perform accurate evaluations (Papadopoulou et al., 2021).\n\n3. **Readiness and Acceptance of AI**:\n   - **Educational Interventions**: Research showed that introducing AI education early in medical curricula significantly increased students' confidence and willingness to engage with AI technologies (Taskiran, 2023). Continuous educational workshops were also effective in improving healthcare professionals' knowledge and attitudes towards AI (Hussein Mohamed et al., 2023).\n   - **Hands-on Experience**: Providing hands-on experience with AI tools was crucial in building confidence among healthcare professionals, allowing them to view AI as an augmentation of their skills rather than a replacement (Narang et al., 2021).\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**:\n   - Several studies emphasized the importance of addressing ethical concerns related to AI in healthcare. The need for clear ethical guidelines and frameworks was highlighted to ensure responsible AI integration in clinical settings (Gosak et al., 2024).\n\n#### Limitations of the Studies\n- Many studies relied on self-reported measures, which may introduce bias.\n- The generalizability of findings is limited due to small sample sizes and specific contexts of the studies.\n- Some studies lacked control groups or comparative analyses, which could affect the robustness of the conclusions drawn.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe synthesis of results from the individual studies indicates that AI has the potential to significantly enhance medical education and practice. However, the successful integration of AI technologies requires a strategic approach that includes comprehensive education, continuous training, ethical considerations, and supportive policies.

The findings indicate that AI is significantly enhancing educational methodologies, improving clinical decision-making, and fostering personalized learning experiences for healthcare professionals. The review highlights various innovative applications of AI, such as virtual simulations and AI-driven diagnostic tools, which are reshaping the training landscape. Furthermore, the review identifies a growing recognition among healthcare professionals regarding the importance of AI in improving patient care and operational efficiency.\n\n#### Limitations of Evidence\nDespite the promising findings, the review acknowledges several limitations inherent in the included studies. Many studies relied on self-reported measures, which can introduce bias and affect the validity of the results. Additionally, the lack of long-term follow-up in many studies limits the ability to assess the sustained impact of AI interventions. The sample sizes in some studies were small, and the specific contexts of the studies may restrict the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, ethical concerns regarding AI technologies and the implications of technological bias were not adequately addressed in many studies, highlighting the need for more rigorous research designs.\n\n#### Limitations of Review Processes\nThe review process itself has limitations, including the reliance on English-language publications and a limited number of databases (Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed). This may have resulted in the exclusion of relevant non-English and interdisciplinary studies. The challenge of synthesizing findings from diverse methodologies also complicates the ability to draw generalized conclusions. Additionally, the rapid advancement of AI technology may not be fully represented in the review, as it primarily focuses on educational uses within healthcare, potentially neglecting other critical areas.\n\n#### Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Research\nThe implications of the review's findings are significant for practice, policy, and future research. For practice, the integration of AI into medical education can enhance the training of healthcare professionals, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. Educational institutions should prioritize the incorporation of AI training into their curricula to prepare future healthcare providers for a technology-driven environment.\n\nFor policy, there is a need for the establishment of ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to govern the use of AI in healthcare. Policymakers should focus on creating supportive infrastructures that facilitate the integration of AI technologies into medical training and practice.\n\nFuture research should address the identified gaps, particularly in the areas of long-term impact assessment, ethical considerations, and the integration of patient perspectives in AI applications. Studies should also explore the effectiveness of different AI training methodologies and their impact on healthcare professionals' readiness to adopt AI technologies.\n\n### Final Score: 4/5\n\n#### Evaluation Points\n- **Strengths:** Comprehensive analysis of AI's role in medical education, identification of innovative applications, and recognition of the importance of AI in improving patient care.\n- **Weaknesses:** Limitations in study designs, potential biases, and lack of representation of non-English studies.\n- **Suggestions:** Future research should focus on long-term impacts, ethical considerations, and broader inclusion of diverse methodologies and perspectives in AI integration studies.", "### Other Information Evaluation of the Systematic Literature Review on AI in Medical Education\n\n#### Registration and Protocol\n- **Registration Details**: The review was not registered.\n- **Protocol Access**: No protocol was prepared for this systematic literature review.\n- **Amendments**: There were no amendments to report as no registration or protocol was established.\n\n#### Support\n- **Sources of Support**: The review did not report any financial or non-financial support, including grant ID numbers.\n- **Role of Funders**: There were no funders or sponsors involved in the review process.\n\n#### Competing Interests\n- **Disclosure of Competing Interests**: The authors did not disclose any relationships or activities that may influence the review. \n- **Management of Competing Interests**: Since no competing interests were reported, there were no management strategies in place.\n\n#### Availability of Data, Code, and Other Materials\n- **Publicly Available Materials**: The review did not specify any publicly available materials such as data collection forms, extracted data, or analytic code.\n- **Access Information**: There was no information provided on how materials could be obtained upon request.\n\n### Final Score: 2/5\n\n#### Evaluation Points\n- **Strengths**: The review provides a comprehensive analysis of the integration of AI in medical education and highlights the importance of AI in improving patient care.\n- **Weaknesses**: The lack of registration, protocol, support, and disclosure of competing interests significantly limits the transparency and credibility of the review.
