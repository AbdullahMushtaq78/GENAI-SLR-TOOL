It mentions the existence of many published articles and the need for automated approaches, but does not deeply analyze the specific gaps or uncertainties in the current literature.\n2. **Importance of the Review:** The rationale states that this is the first review to cover both ML and AI for detection, diagnosis, self-management, and personalization of DM therapy, and highlights the value of summarizing current research for the scientific community. However, the justification for why this review is needed now, or what specific new insights it aims to provide, is only moderately developed.\n3. **Existing Reviews and Necessity:** The section briefly mentions that only a few review papers exist and that previous reviews have not addressed certain aspects (e.g., databases, pre-processing, feature extraction, AI solutions for intelligent DM assistants). However, it does not systematically compare this review to existing ones or clearly state if previous reviews are outdated, discordant, or methodologically limited.\n4. **Update or Replication:** There is no explicit mention of this review being an update or replication of a previous review, nor are prior reviews specifically cited in this context.\n5. **Intervention Mechanisms:** The rationale briefly describes how ML and AI approaches can improve DM detection and management, but does not provide a conceptual framework or logic model for how these interventions work or interact with outcomes.\n6. **Complexity/Logic Model:** No logic model or conceptual framework is provided to illustrate the complexity of interventions or the context of their delivery.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Provides a broad context for the importance of DM and the potential of ML/AI.\n- Identifies a gap in the literature regarding comprehensive reviews that include both ML and AI for DM detection, diagnosis, and self-management.\n- Outlines the main objectives and structure of the review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lacks a detailed analysis of the current state of knowledge and specific uncertainties.\n- Does not systematically compare with or cite existing reviews to justify the necessity of this review.\n- Does not include a logic model or conceptual framework for intervention complexity.\n- The rationale for the review’s timing and unique contribution is only moderately articulated.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Provide a more detailed discussion of existing reviews, including their limitations and how this review addresses them.\n- Clearly articulate the specific gaps or uncertainties in the literature that this review aims to fill.\n- Include a brief conceptual framework or logic model, especially if discussing complex interventions or self-management systems.\n- Explicitly state if this review is an update or replication, and cite previous reviews accordingly.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe rationale section moderately addresses the requirements for a systematic review rationale.

The review lists seven specific objectives, covering datasets, pre-processing, feature extraction, ML and AI techniques, performance metrics, and future research directions in the context of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) detection, diagnosis, and self-management.\n2. **Clarity and Scope:** The objectives are articulated in a clear and concise manner, providing a comprehensive overview of the intended scope of the review. Each objective is specific and collectively they cover the breadth of the review’s focus areas.\n3. **Alignment with Frameworks:** While the objectives are well-structured, they are not explicitly framed using a standard question formulation framework such as PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) or its variants. However, the objectives do implicitly address key elements relevant to such frameworks (e.g., population: people with DM; interventions: ML/AI techniques; outcomes: detection, diagnosis, self-management, performance metrics).\n4. **Relevance to Methods:** The objectives are sufficiently detailed to guide the selection of eligibility criteria, search methods, data items, and synthesis approaches. The review’s structure and subsequent sections appear to align with these objectives.\n5. **Comprehensiveness:** The objectives encompass both technical (datasets, algorithms, performance) and practical (self-management, personalization, future directions) aspects, which is a strength.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Objectives are explicitly stated and cover all major aspects relevant to the review’s scope.\n- The section provides clarity for readers regarding what the review will address.\n- The objectives are sufficiently detailed to inform methodological decisions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The objectives are not explicitly formulated using a recognized framework such as PICO, which is recommended for systematic reviews, especially those evaluating interventions.\n- There is no explicit mention of the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome in a structured format.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Consider rephrasing the objectives using a standard framework (e.g., PICO or PICOS) to enhance clarity and methodological rigor, especially if the review aims to evaluate the effects of interventions.\n- Explicitly state the population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes where relevant.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe objectives section is clear, comprehensive, and well-aligned with the review’s scope and methods.

While the review presents a large amount of synthesized information, it lacks any explicit description of how data were collected, who was involved, or how accuracy and consistency were ensured. The absence of detail on reviewer roles, disagreement resolution, author contact, translation, automation, and decision rules significantly limits the transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of the review's findings.\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**.", '**Evaluation of Data Items in the SLR**\n\n**Final Score: 2/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n**Responsibility 1: Outcome Domains**\n1. **Definition and Clarity:** The SLR identifies several outcome domains relevant to diabetes detection and management using ML/AI, such as dataset characteristics, pre-processing methods, feature extraction, classification/diagnosis algorithms, and performance measures. However, these domains are not always explicitly or systematically defined at the outset. The review does not provide a clear, structured list of primary and secondary outcomes, nor does it specify time frames for measurement or follow-up for included studies.\n\n2. **Comprehensiveness and Selection Process:** The review attempts to cover all results compatible with each outcome domain by summarizing the types of datasets, features, algorithms, and performance metrics used in the included studies. However, the process for selecting which results to extract and report is not transparent. There is no description of prioritization (e.g., which performance metrics are considered most important), nor is there a hierarchy or rationale for selecting among multiple reported results within studies.\n\n3. **Changes and Justification:** There is no documentation of any changes to the inclusion or definition of outcome domains during the review process, nor is there any explanation of how or why such changes might have occurred.\n\n4. **Selection from Multiple Results:** When multiple results are available for a given outcome domain (e.g., several performance metrics or multiple algorithms per study), the methods for selecting which results to report are not described. The review often lists all available results in summary tables but does not explain any process for prioritization or selection for synthesis.\n\n5. **Critical/Important Outcomes:** The SLR does not explicitly specify which outcome domains are considered "critical" or "important" for the review’s conclusions, nor does it provide a rationale for any such prioritization.\n\n**Responsibility 2: Other Variables**\n1. **Listing and Definition:** The review provides extensive tables and narrative summaries listing other variables such as dataset names, sample sizes, data types, feature types (shape, color, texture, text), and algorithmic approaches. However, definitions are sometimes implicit rather than explicit, and not all variables (e.g., participant demographics, study settings, funding sources) are consistently reported or defined.\n\n2. **Assumptions about Missing/Unclear Data:** There is no clear statement of assumptions made about missing or unclear information. The review does not describe how missing data were handled or what was done when study characteristics were not explicitly defined in the original reports.\n\n3. **Use of Tools/Frameworks:** There is no mention of any specific tool or framework used to inform the selection of data items (e.g., for documenting conflicts of interest or intervention characteristics).\n\n4. **Comprehensiveness and Consistency:** While the review is comprehensive in its coverage of technical variables (datasets, features, algorithms, performance metrics), it is less consistent in reporting participant characteristics, study settings, and other contextual variables. The data collection process is not described in sufficient detail to ensure consistency with eligibility criteria or to guarantee that all relevant data items are accounted for.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides detailed tables and narrative summaries of datasets, features, algorithms, and performance metrics used in included studies.\n- There is a broad attempt to capture the landscape of ML/AI approaches for diabetes detection and management.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Outcome domains and other variables are not always explicitly defined or prioritized.\n- The process for selecting, extracting, and reporting data items is not transparent or systematic.\n- No documentation of changes to data items or justification for such changes.\n- No clear handling of missing or unclear data, and no use of standardized tools or frameworks for data item selection.\n- Inconsistent reporting of participant and study characteristics beyond technical variables.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Clearly define all outcome domains and other variables at the outset, including time frames and prioritization of outcomes.\n- Specify and justify the process for selecting which results to extract and report, especially when multiple results are available.\n- Document any changes to data items or their definitions during the review process, with rationale.\n- State assumptions and procedures for handling missing or unclear data.\n- Use or cite standardized tools/frameworks for data item selection and reporting.\n- Ensure comprehensive and consistent reporting of all relevant variables, including participant and study characteristics, to enhance transparency and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR provides a broad and detailed overview of technical data items (datasets, features, algorithms, performance metrics) but lacks explicit definitions, transparent selection processes, and systematic reporting for both outcome domains and other variables. The absence of clear prioritization, handling of missing data, and use of standardized frameworks limits the transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of the review’s data collection and reporting.\n\n**Score: 2/5 (Partially Addressed)**.', '**Evaluation of Risk of Bias Assessment Methods in the SLR**\n\n**Final Score: 0/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Tool(s) Used:**\n   - There is no mention of any risk of bias assessment tool (e.g., Cochrane RoB, QUADAS, ROBINS-I, or any custom tool) used to evaluate the included studies. No version or adaptation is specified.\n\n2. **Reporting of Domains/Components/Items:**\n   - The SLR does not report any methodological domains, components, or items related to risk of bias. There is no description of what aspects of study quality or bias were considered.\n\n3. **Overall Risk of Bias Judgment and Rules:**\n   - There is no indication that an overall risk of bias judgment was made for any included study, nor are any rules or criteria for such judgments described.\n\n4. **Adaptations to Existing Tools:**\n   - There is no evidence that any existing risk of bias tool was adapted, nor is there any description of modifications or omitted items.\n\n5. **Development and Accessibility of New Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of a newly developed risk of bias tool, nor is any content or public accessibility described.\n\n6. **Reviewers and Disagreement Resolution:**\n   - The SLR does not report how many reviewers (if any) assessed risk of bias, whether assessments were performed independently, or how disagreements were resolved.\n\n7. **Contacting Study Investigators:**\n   - There is no mention of any process to obtain or confirm information from study investigators regarding risk of bias or study quality.\n\n8. **Use of Automation Tools:**\n   - There is no indication that any automation tool was used for risk of bias assessment.

There is no mention of any tool, process, or outcome related to risk of bias, nor any reporting of reviewer roles or procedures. This represents a major methodological omission, severely limiting the transparency, reliability, and interpretability of the review’s findings.\n\n**Score: 0/5 (Not Addressed)**.', '**Evaluation of Effect Measures in the SLR**\n\n**Final Score: 1/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Effect Measures for Each Outcome (Essential):**\n   - The SLR reviews a wide range of studies on ML/AI for diabetes detection and management, summarizing performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. However, it does not explicitly specify, for each outcome or outcome type, the effect measure(s) used in the synthesis or presentation of results. The review lists the metrics reported in individual studies but does not standardize or clearly define which effect measures are used for each outcome domain across the review.\n\n2. **Thresholds or Ranges for Interpreting Effect Size (Essential):**\n   - There is no documentation of thresholds or ranges used to interpret the size of effects (e.g., what constitutes a "good" or "poor" accuracy, sensitivity, or AUC). The review does not state any minimally important differences or provide ranges for interpreting effect sizes, nor does it offer a rationale for any implicit thresholds.\n\n3. **Re-expression of Synthesized Results to Different Effect Measures (Essential):**\n   - The SLR does not report any re-expression of synthesized results to different effect measures (e.g., converting accuracy to absolute risk reduction or other forms). There is no documentation of methods for re-expressing effect measures, and no evidence that such re-expression was attempted or considered.\n\n4. **Justification for Choice of Effect Measures (Additional):**\n   - The review does not provide any justification for the choice of effect measures. While it reports the performance metrics used in the included studies, it does not explain why these particular metrics were chosen for synthesis or why others were not. There is no discussion of the appropriateness of different effect measures for the outcomes or data types considered.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides a comprehensive tabulation of performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, etc.) reported in the included studies, giving readers a sense of the range of effect measures used in the field.\n- The review attempts to summarize the landscape of effect measures as reported in primary studies.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit specification of effect measures for each outcome or outcome type in the synthesis.\n- No thresholds, ranges, or rationale for interpreting the size of effects are provided.\n- No documentation of re-expression of effect measures or methods for doing so.\n- No justification for the choice of effect measures is given.\n- The reporting is descriptive and lacks the clarity, transparency, and methodological rigor expected for effect measures in systematic reviews.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Clearly specify, for each outcome or outcome type, the effect measure(s) used in the synthesis and presentation of results.\n- State and justify any thresholds or ranges used to interpret the size of effects, including minimally important differences or categories (e.g., what constitutes "high" accuracy).\n- If results are re-expressed to different effect measures, document the methods and rationale for doing so.\n- Provide a justification for the choice of effect measures, especially when multiple options exist (e.g., why accuracy and AUC are prioritized over other metrics).\n- Consider standardizing effect measures across studies to facilitate synthesis and interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR minimally addresses the requirements for documenting effect measures. While it reports the performance metrics used in included studies, it does not specify effect measures for each outcome, provide thresholds or interpretive ranges, document re-expression methods, or justify the choice of effect measures. The absence of these elements limits the transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility of the review’s findings regarding effect sizes and their meaning.\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**.', '**Evaluation of Synthesis Methods in the SLR**\n\n**Final Score: 1/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n**Responsibility 1: Describe the processes used to decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis**\n- The SLR does not clearly describe the processes used to determine which studies were eligible for each synthesis. While it mentions grouping studies by facets such as datasets, pre-processing, feature extraction, and ML/AI techniques, there is no explicit, structured approach to grouping or coding studies for synthesis. There is no tabulation or coding of main characteristics for synthesis purposes, nor is there a structured approach to grouping studies for different syntheses. \n\n**Responsibility 2: Describe any methods required to prepare the data for presentation or synthesis**\n- The SLR does not report any methods used to prepare data for synthesis or presentation. There is no mention of handling missing data, imputing values, converting effect measures, or performing algebraic manipulations. The review simply summarizes the results as reported in the included studies, without describing any data preparation steps or assumptions.\n\n**Responsibility 3: Describe any methods used to tabulate or visually display results of individual studies and syntheses**\n- The SLR presents summary tables of datasets, features, algorithms, and performance metrics, but does not describe the rationale for the tabular structures or any graphical methods. There is no mention of forest plots, summary of findings tables, or other standard visualizations. The rationale for ordering or grouping studies in tables is not provided, and no non-standard graphs are used or justified. The tabular methods used are not discussed in terms of transparency or pattern identification.\n\n**Responsibility 4: Documentation of synthesis methods, including meta-analysis**\n- The SLR does not perform or describe any quantitative synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis). There is no mention of statistical models, heterogeneity assessment, or software used for synthesis. The review is entirely narrative and descriptive, with no rationale for model selection, no quantification of heterogeneity, and no details of statistical tools. There is no explanation for why meta-analysis or other statistical synthesis was not performed, nor is there any discussion of the appropriateness of synthesis methods.\n\n**Responsibility 5: Methods to explore possible causes of heterogeneity**\n- The SLR does not report any methods to explore heterogeneity among study results. There are no subgroup analyses, meta-regressions, or other approaches to investigate sources of variation. The review does not document any factors or levels explored for heterogeneity, nor does it mention any analyses that were not pre-specified.\n\n**Responsibility 6: Sensitivity analyses**\n- The SLR does not report any sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of synthesized results. There is no mention of removing studies at high risk of bias, using alternative synthesis models, or any other form of sensitivity analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides comprehensive tables summarizing datasets, features, algorithms, and performance metrics from included studies.\n- The review attempts to give a broad overview of the landscape of ML/AI approaches for diabetes detection and management.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit or transparent description of synthesis methods, grouping, or eligibility for synthesis.\n- No data preparation methods or handling of missing/unclear data described.\n- No rationale or methods for tabulation or visualization of results.\n- No quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) or rationale for its absence.\n- No exploration of heterogeneity or sensitivity analyses.\n- The synthesis is entirely narrative and lacks methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Clearly describe the processes for grouping studies for synthesis, including tabulation and coding of key characteristics.\n- Report any data preparation methods, including handling of missing data and transformation of effect measures.\n- Justify the choice of tabular and graphical methods for presenting results, and explain how they facilitate understanding and transparency.\n- If quantitative synthesis is not possible, provide a rationale and describe alternative synthesis methods.\n- Explore possible causes of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis or meta-regression where appropriate.\n- Conduct and report sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings.\n- Ensure all synthesis methods are reported in sufficient detail to allow replication and critical appraisal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR minimally addresses the requirements for reporting synthesis methods. While it provides descriptive tables and narrative summaries, it lacks explicit, transparent, and systematic methods for grouping studies, preparing data, presenting results, conducting synthesis, exploring heterogeneity, and assessing robustness. The absence of these elements severely limits the transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of the review’s findings.\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**.', '**Evaluation of Methods Used to Assess Risk of Bias Due to Missing Results (Reporting Bias) in the SLR**\n\n**Final Score: 0/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Methods for Assessing Reporting Bias:**\n   - The SLR does not specify any methods for assessing the risk of bias due to missing results (arising from reporting biases).

It states that two databases (Scopus and PubMed) were searched, with initial results of 1000 (DML) and 1403 (DAI) records, narrowed to 300 and 450 by date restriction. Manual review reduced these to 79 (DML) and 28 (DAI), for a total of 107 included studies. \n- There is a reference to a workflow (Fig. 2) that presumably serves as a flow diagram, but the actual diagram is not included in the provided text, nor is its content described in detail.\n- The process of duplicate removal, records excluded before screening, and the number of full-texts retrieved and assessed for eligibility are not explicitly reported. There is no breakdown of records excluded at each stage, nor are reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage provided.\n- There is no mention of potentially eligible reports that were not retrievable, nor of ongoing studies.\n- There is no clear distinction between exclusions by automation and by human judgment.\n\n**Responsibility 2: Reporting Excluded Studies and Reasons**\n- The review does not provide a list or table of studies that appeared eligible but were excluded, nor does it cite excluded studies or provide reasons for their exclusion.\n- There is no discussion of potentially contentious exclusions or studies that could not be retrieved.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides a basic narrative of the search and selection process, including the databases searched, search terms, and the final number of included studies.\n- The narrowing of results through date restriction and manual review is described.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The reporting lacks detail at each stage of the selection process (e.g., duplicates removed, records screened, full-texts assessed, reasons for exclusion).\n- No flow diagram or equivalent is presented in the text, and the referenced figure is not described.\n- There is no list or table of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion.\n- No information is provided on studies that could not be retrieved or on the use of automation tools versus human judgment in exclusions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1.

This allows for traceability and accessibility for readers.\n\n2. **Presentation of Key Study Characteristics**\n   - The review presents a detailed table (Table 1) summarizing the datasets used in the included studies. This table includes dataset names, descriptions/URLs, and references to the publications in which they are used. This facilitates comparison across studies regarding data sources.\n   - However, for other key study characteristics (such as study design, participant characteristics, outcome ascertainment methods, funding sources, and competing interests), the reporting is inconsistent or absent. While some information about the type of data (e.g., self-created vs. public datasets, sample sizes, and some demographic details) is provided, there is no standardized table or figure that comprehensively presents these characteristics for all included studies.\n   - There is no explicit reporting of outcome ascertainment methods (e.g., self-reported vs. validated outcomes), funding sources, or competing interests for the included studies.\n\n3. **Intervention Details (if applicable)**\n   - The review does not focus on intervention effects, so a TIDieR-style table is not expected. However, for studies involving machine learning or AI interventions, there is some summary of the types of algorithms and features used (Table 3 and Table 4), but these are not structured according to a standardized intervention reporting template. Missing details and elements not investigated are not systematically highlighted.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides a thorough list of included studies with clear citations, supporting traceability.\n- Table 1 offers a detailed overview of datasets, including descriptions and references, which is valuable for understanding the data sources used in the included studies.\n- There is some effort to summarize methodological approaches (e.g., types of machine learning algorithms, features used) in additional tables.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- There is no single, comprehensive table or figure that presents all key study characteristics (study design, participant demographics, outcome ascertainment, funding, competing interests) for each included study.\n- Important elements such as outcome ascertainment methods, funding sources, and competing interests are not systematically reported.\n- For studies involving interventions (e.g., ML/AI models), details are scattered and not presented in a standardized, replicable format.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Create a comprehensive table summarizing key characteristics for each included study, including study design, participant characteristics (age, sex, sample size), outcome ascertainment methods, funding sources, and competing interests.\n2. For studies involving interventions (ML/AI models), consider an additional table structured according to the TIDieR framework or similar, detailing intervention components, missing details, and elements not investigated.\n3. Ensure that all included studies are consistently cited in the main text and tables for full traceability.\n4. Explicitly report any missing or unclear information for included studies, and discuss the potential impact of these gaps on the review's findings.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe review moderately addresses the reporting of study characteristics. While citations and dataset details are well-covered, there is a lack of comprehensive, standardized reporting of other key study characteristics. The review would benefit from more systematic and detailed tabular presentation of study designs, participant characteristics, outcome ascertainment, funding, and competing interests to fully meet PRISMA 2020 standards.\n\n**Score: 3/5 (Moderately Addressed)**", '**Evaluation of Risk of Bias Reporting According to PRISMA 2020 Guidelines**\n\n**Final Score: 0/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Presentation of Risk of Bias Assessments (Tables/Figures):**\n   - There is no table, figure, or summary in the review that presents, for each included study, the risk of bias in each domain/component/item assessed (e.g., blinding, missing data) or the overall study-level risk of bias. No structured risk of bias tool (e.g., RoB 2.0, QUADAS-2) is mentioned or applied.\n\n2. **Justifications for Risk of Bias Judgments:**\n   - The review does not provide any justifications, quotations, or descriptions from the included studies to support risk of bias judgments. In fact, there is no evidence that any risk of bias assessment was conducted at all.\n\n3. **Display of Risk of Bias Judgments Alongside Study Results:**\n   - There are no forest plots or similar visualizations in which risk of bias judgments are displayed alongside study results. The limitations of studies contributing to any meta-analyses or syntheses are not made evident in this way.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- None identified. The review does not address risk of bias assessment in any form.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No mention or application of any risk of bias assessment tool or framework.\n- No tabular or narrative summary of risk of bias for included studies.\n- No justifications or supporting evidence for risk of bias judgments.\n- No integration of risk of bias information with study results or syntheses.\n- No discussion of the potential impact of risk of bias on the review’s findings or conclusions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Conduct a formal risk of bias assessment for each included study using an appropriate tool (e.g., RoB 2.0 for RCTs, QUADAS-2 for diagnostic studies, or a relevant tool for ML/AI studies).\n2. Present the results of the risk of bias assessment in a table or figure, showing judgments for each domain and the overall risk of bias for each study.\n3. Provide justifications for each risk of bias judgment, including relevant quotations or descriptions from the original study reports.\n4. If meta-analyses or syntheses are performed, display risk of bias judgments alongside study results (e.g., in forest plots) to make study limitations transparent.\n5. Discuss the implications of risk of bias for the review’s findings, including sensitivity analyses or subgroup analyses if appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe review does not address risk of bias assessment for included studies in any way. This is a critical omission that undermines the transparency and credibility of the review’s findings. Comprehensive risk of bias assessment and reporting are essential for readers to judge the internal validity and reliability of the included evidence.\n\n**Score: 0/5 (Not Addressed)**', '**Evaluation of Individual Study Results Reporting According to PRISMA 2020 Guidelines**\n\n**Final Score: 2/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Summary Statistics for Each Group and Study**\n   - The review provides some summary statistics for datasets (e.g., sample sizes, dataset descriptions in Table 1), and for some studies, performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC) are reported in Table 4. However, for most outcomes, summary statistics for each group (e.g., number of events, means, SDs) are not systematically presented for each included study. There is no consistent reporting of group-level data (e.g., intervention vs. control, or algorithm vs. comparator) for all outcomes.\n\n2. **Effect Estimates and Precision**\n   - Effect estimates (such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC) are reported for many studies in Table 4, but the precision of these estimates (e.g., standard errors, 95% confidence intervals) is almost never provided. There is no systematic reporting of effect estimates with their precision for each study, which limits interpretability and reusability.\n\n3. **Visual or Tabular Presentation of Study-Level Data**\n   - Study-level results are presented in tabular format (notably Table 4 for ML performance, Table 1 for datasets, and Table 3 for features). However, there are no forest plots or similar visualizations that would facilitate comparison across studies. The tables are helpful but lack the granularity and structure expected for full transparency.\n\n4. **Source of Data**\n   - The source of data for each study is generally reported in Table 1, with dataset names, descriptions, URLs, and references. This is a strength of the review and supports traceability.\n\n5. **Computed or Estimated Results**\n   - There is no explicit indication in the tables or text as to whether any results were computed or estimated by the review authors (rather than directly reported in the original studies). This should be specified for transparency, especially if any data transformations or calculations were performed.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Study-level results (mainly performance metrics) are presented in tabular format, allowing some degree of comparison.\n- Data sources for included studies are clearly reported, supporting transparency and reusability.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Summary statistics for each group and outcome are not systematically reported for all studies.\n- Effect estimates are often presented without measures of precision (e.g., confidence intervals).\n- No visual presentation (e.g., forest plots) of individual study results is provided.\n- It is not specified whether any results were computed or estimated by the review authors.\n- The tables, while helpful, do not fully meet the standards for comprehensive, reusable reporting of individual study results.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. For each included study, present summary statistics for all relevant groups and outcomes (e.g., number of events, means, SDs, sample sizes) in a structured table.\n2. Report effect estimates with their precision (e.g., 95% confidence intervals or standard errors) for all outcomes, regardless of whether a meta-analysis was performed.\n3. Include visual representations (such as forest plots) to facilitate comparison and interpretation of study-level results.\n4. Clearly indicate the source of all data, and specify if any results were computed or estimated by the review authors.\n5. Ensure that all tables are structured to maximize clarity, transparency, and reusability of the data for future syntheses.\n\n**Confirmation of Structured Tables/Plots:**\n- Structured tables are used (notably Table 1 and Table 4), but no plots (e.g., forest plots) are provided. The tables are helpful but incomplete for full PRISMA compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe review partially addresses the requirements for reporting individual study results. While some study-level data and performance metrics are tabulated, there is a lack of comprehensive summary statistics, effect estimate precision, and visual presentation. Improvements in these areas are needed to fully support understanding, transparency, and reusability of the data.\n\n**Score: 2/5 (Partially Addressed)**', '**Evaluation of Synthesis of Study Results According to PRISMA 2020 Guidelines**\n\n**Final Score: 1/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n### Responsibility 1: Evaluation of Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias (for each synthesis)\n- **Presence of Summary of Study Characteristics:** The review provides some summary of datasets and features (Tables 1 and 3), and lists included studies, but does not provide a synthesis-level summary of essential characteristics for each synthesis. There is no explicit grouping of studies by synthesis, nor a clear mapping of which studies contribute to which synthesis.\n- **Risk of Bias Summary:** There is no mention or summary of risk of bias for studies contributing to any synthesis. No risk of bias tool is used, and no narrative or tabular summary is provided.\n- **Explicit Listing of Studies in Each Synthesis:** While studies are cited in tables, there is no explicit listing of which studies contribute to each synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis or narrative synthesis). The review is largely descriptive and does not organize results by synthesis.\n- **Documentation of Essential Characteristics:** Some characteristics (e.g., dataset type, sample size) are documented, but not in a way that supports interpretation of synthesized results. There is no discussion of applicability or limitations due to study characteristics or risk of bias.\n\n### Responsibility 2: Evaluation of Statistical Synthesis Results\n- **Reporting of Statistical Syntheses:** The review does not conduct or report any formal statistical syntheses (e.g., meta-analyses). Results are presented as a narrative and in tables, but there is no pooling of effect estimates.\n- **Summary Estimates and Precision:** Where performance metrics are reported (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity), they are presented for individual studies, not as summary estimates across studies. Precision (e.g., confidence intervals) is almost never reported.\n- **Measures of Heterogeneity:** No measures of statistical heterogeneity (e.g., I2, τ2) are reported, as no meta-analyses are conducted.\n- **Direction of Effect and Units:** The direction of effect is not consistently stated, and units of measurement are not always clear. For machine learning performance, the meaning of higher/lower values is generally implied but not explicitly discussed.\n- **Standardized Mean Differences/Instrument Description:** Not applicable, as no such syntheses are performed.\n\n### Responsibility 3: Evaluation of Heterogeneity Investigations (for all syntheses)\n- **Investigation of Heterogeneity:** There is no investigation or reporting of heterogeneity among study results. No subgroup analyses, meta-regressions, or informal explorations of heterogeneity are presented.\n- **Identification of Studies in Subgroups:** Not applicable, as no subgroups or heterogeneity analyses are conducted.\n- **Reporting of Interaction Tests or Meta-Regression:** Not applicable.\n- **Informal Methods:** No informal grouping or discussion of heterogeneity is provided.\n\n### Responsibility 4: Evaluation of Sensitivity Analyses Results\n- **Reporting of Sensitivity Analyses:** No sensitivity analyses are conducted or reported.\n- **Presentation of Results and Robustness:** Not applicable.\n- **Tables/Plots for Sensitivity Analyses:** Not applicable.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides a broad narrative synthesis and tabulates some study-level results (e.g., performance metrics, datasets, features).\n- Included studies are cited and some characteristics are described, supporting a basic level of transparency.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No formal syntheses (meta-analyses or statistical pooling) are conducted or reported.\n- No risk of bias assessment or summary is provided for studies contributing to syntheses.\n- No investigation or reporting of heterogeneity or sensitivity analyses.\n- No summary estimates, measures of precision, or heterogeneity statistics are reported.\n- The review does not organize results by synthesis or clearly indicate which studies contribute to which results.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. If statistical syntheses are not feasible, provide a clear rationale and organize the narrative synthesis to address the review questions explicitly.\n2. For each synthesis (even if narrative), summarize the essential characteristics and risk of bias of contributing studies, and discuss how these may affect the results.\n3. If possible, conduct and report meta-analyses for key outcomes, including summary estimates, measures of precision, and heterogeneity statistics.\n4. Investigate and report on heterogeneity among study results, using subgroup analyses or meta-regression where appropriate.\n5. Conduct and report sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of synthesized results.\n6. Clearly list which studies contribute to each synthesis, and present results in structured tables or plots (e.g., forest plots) where possible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe synthesis of study results in this SLR is minimally addressed according to PRISMA 2020 standards. While some study-level data are tabulated and discussed, there is no formal synthesis, no risk of bias or heterogeneity assessment, and no sensitivity analyses. The review would benefit greatly from more structured, transparent, and comprehensive synthesis methods and reporting.\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**', "**Evaluation of Risk of Reporting Bias Due to Missing Results in Syntheses**\n\n**Final Score: 0/5**\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Assessment of Risk of Bias Due to Missing Results in Each Synthesis**\n   - The review does not present any explicit assessment of the risk of bias due to missing results (reporting biases) for any synthesis.

No code repositories (e.g., GitHub, OSF) are cited, and there is no statement about code availability or how to request it.\n- **Other Materials:** No other supporting materials (e.g., search strategies, full search strings, additional tables, or appendices) are made available or referenced. There is no mention of supplementary files or online resources.\n- **Access Details:** The paper does not provide any links, DOIs, or contact information for requesting materials. There is no statement about the conditions under which materials might be shared, nor any contact details for the corresponding author regarding data or code requests.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review is comprehensive in its narrative synthesis and tabulation of published studies, datasets, and methods.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Complete absence of any statement or provision regarding the availability of data, analytic code, or supporting materials.\n- No public repository links, supplementary files, or instructions for requesting materials.\n- No transparency regarding the underlying data or analytic processes, which limits reproducibility and reuse.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Make all relevant materials (e.g., data extraction forms, extracted data, analytic code) publicly available in a recognized repository (e.g., OSF, Dryad, figshare) and provide direct links in the paper.\n- If some materials cannot be shared publicly, provide a clear statement explaining why and include contact details for the responsible author, along with the conditions for sharing upon request.\n- At minimum, include a statement about the availability (or unavailability) of materials and how to request them.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis systematic review does not provide any information or access to data, analytic code, or other supporting materials. There are no public repositories, supplementary files, or statements about material availability. This is a significant omission that undermines the transparency, reproducibility, and utility of the review. Immediate improvements are needed to meet best practice standards for systematic reviews regarding data and material availability.']}}
