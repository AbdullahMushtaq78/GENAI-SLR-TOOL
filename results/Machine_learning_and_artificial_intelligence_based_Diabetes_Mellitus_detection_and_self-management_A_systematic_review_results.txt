Thanks to advances in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, which enables the early detection and diagnosis of DM through an automated process which is more advantageous than a manual diagnosis. Currently, many articles are published on automatic DM detection, diagnosis, and self-management via machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence techniques. This review delivers an analysis of the detection, diagnosis, and self-management techniques of DM from six different facets viz., datasets of DM, pre-processing methods, feature extraction methods, machine learning-based iden- tiﬁcation, classiﬁcation, and diagnosis of DM, artiﬁcial intelligence-based intelligent DM assistant and performance measures. It also discusses the conclusions of the previous study and the importance of the results of the study. Also, three current research issues in the ﬁeld of DM detection and diagnosis and self-management and personalization are listed. After a thorough screening procedure, 107 main publications from the Scopus and PubMed repositories are chosen for this study. This review provides a detailed overview of DM detection and self-management techniques which may prove valuable to the community of scientists employed in the area of automatic DM detection and self-management.

It mentions the existence of many published articles and the need for automated approaches. However, the discussion of uncertainties in the current knowledge is limited and lacks depth.\n\n2. **Importance of Conducting the Review:** The rationale states that this is the first review to cover both ML and AI for DM detection, diagnosis, self-management, and personalization, and highlights the need for a comprehensive summary for the research community. The importance is stated but could be more explicitly justified in the context of existing reviews.\n\n3. **Existing Reviews and Necessity of This Review:** The section briefly mentions that only a few review papers exist and that previous reviews have not addressed certain aspects (e.g., databases, pre-processing, feature extraction, AI solutions for intelligent DM assistants). However, it does not provide a detailed comparison with existing reviews, nor does it clearly state if previous reviews are outdated, discordant, or methodologically limited.\n\n4. **Update or Replication of Existing Review:** There is no explicit mention of this review being an update or replication, nor are previous reviews specifically cited in this context.\n\n5. **Description of Interventions and How They Might Work:** The rationale describes the general approach of ML and AI in DM detection and management, but does not provide a brief mechanism of how these interventions work or a conceptual framework for their operation.\n\n6. **Logic Model or Conceptual Framework:** No logic model, conceptual framework, or visual representation of the hypothesized relationships between intervention components and outcomes is provided, despite the complexity of the interventions discussed.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clearly identifies the growing importance of ML and AI in DM detection and management.\n- States the novelty of the review in covering both ML and AI approaches, including self-management and personalization.\n- Outlines the main objectives and structure of the review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Limited discussion of the uncertainties in the current state of knowledge.\n- Insufficient comparison with existing systematic reviews; lacks explicit justification for the necessity of this review in light of previous work.\n- Does not provide a logic model or conceptual framework, despite the complexity of the interventions.\n- Mechanisms of how interventions (ML/AI systems) work are not briefly described.\n- No explicit mention of whether this is an update or replication of previous reviews.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Expand the discussion of uncertainties and gaps in the current literature.\n- Provide a more detailed comparison with existing reviews, including citations and explicit reasons why this review is needed (e.g., outdated methods, new developments, methodological flaws in previous reviews).\n- Include a brief description or diagram of how ML and AI interventions are hypothesized to work in DM detection and management.\n- If applicable, add a logic model or conceptual framework to clarify the relationships between intervention components and outcomes.\n- Clearly state if this review is an update or replication, and cite previous reviews accordingly.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe rationale section is moderately addressed.

While the objectives mention datasets, pre-processing, feature extraction, ML/AI techniques, and performance measures, there is no systematic breakdown of Population, Intervention, Comparator, or Outcomes. The population (e.g., type of patients, age, setting) is not clearly defined, nor are the interventions or comparators. Outcomes are only loosely referenced as "detection, diagnosis, and self-management techniques of DM."\n\n2. **Other Relevant Characteristics (Study Design, Setting, Follow-up):**\n   - The eligibility criteria do not specify study designs (e.g., RCTs, observational studies, case series), settings (e.g., hospital, community), or minimum duration of follow-up. There is no mention of whether only primary research, reviews, or both were included.\n\n3. **Report Characteristics (Year, Language, Report Status):**\n   - The review restricts included studies to those published between 2015 and 2020, which is clearly stated. However, there is no mention of language restrictions or whether unpublished manuscripts, conference abstracts, or only peer-reviewed articles were included.\n\n4. **Exclusions Based on Outcomes:**\n   - There is no explicit statement about exclusions based on outcomes not being measured or reported. The process for handling studies with missing or irrelevant outcome data is not described.\n\n5. **Linkage to Review Objectives:**\n   - The eligibility criteria are only loosely linked to the objectives. While the objectives list the types of data and methods of interest, there is no clear mapping of how included studies are grouped for synthesis or how eligibility decisions are verified against the objectives.\n\n6. **Rationales for Restrictions:**\n   - The rationale for the 2015–2020 publication date restriction is provided (to narrow the search due to a large number of papers), but no rationale is given for other potential restrictions (e.g., language, study design).\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review clearly states the databases searched (Scopus and PubMed) and the time frame (2015–2020).\n- The objectives are well articulated, providing a general sense of the scope.\n- The process of manual review and categorization of studies is described.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit, detailed eligibility criteria are provided for inclusion/exclusion of studies.\n- Lack of clarity on population, intervention, comparator, and outcome definitions.\n- No specification of study design, setting, or follow-up duration.\n- No mention of language or publication status restrictions.\n- No clear linkage between eligibility criteria and synthesis groups/objectives.\n- No detailed rationale for most eligibility restrictions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1.

Report any efforts to obtain or confirm information from study authors.\n4. State whether translation was required and, if so, how it was performed.\n5. If automation tools or crowdsourcing are used, describe their integration and impact on the process.\n6. Provide a detailed PRISMA flow diagram with numbers at each stage and reasons for exclusion.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe study selection process in this SLR is only minimally addressed. While a general workflow is described, the lack of detail on reviewer roles, disagreement resolution, translation, and use of automation or crowdsourcing limits transparency and reproducibility. Major improvements are needed to meet best-practice standards for systematic reviews.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The review meets the minimum standard by describing a basic workflow, but lacks the depth, detail, and transparency required for a higher score. The absence of key methodological details justifies a score of 2/5.', '**SLR Data Collection Process Evaluation**\n\n**Final Score:** 2/5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Data Collection Methods and Reviewers:**\n   - The review does not clearly specify how data were collected from included reports. There is no mention of how many reviewers were involved in data extraction, whether they worked independently, or if data were checked by a second reviewer. The process is described only in general terms (e.g., "manual review"), with no detail on the data extraction phase itself.\n\n2. **Disagreement Resolution:**\n   - There is no description of how disagreements between data extractors (if more than one was involved) were resolved. No mention of consensus meetings, referral to a third party, or any formal process for resolving discrepancies in data collection.\n\n3. **Contacting Study Investigators:**\n   - The review does not report any process for obtaining or confirming data from study investigators. There is no mention of attempts to contact authors for missing or unclear information.\n\n4. **Use of Automation Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of automation tools (e.g., machine learning models, data extraction software) being used for data collection. All processes appear to be manual, and no validation or risk mitigation for automation is described.\n\n5. **Translation Methods:**\n   - The review does not report whether any articles in languages other than English were included, nor does it describe any translation methods (e.g., use of native speakers or translation software).\n\n6. **Software for Data Extraction from Figures:**\n   - There is no mention of any software used to extract data from figures or images in the included studies.\n\n7. **Decision Rules for Multiple Reports:**\n   - The review does not describe any decision rules for selecting data from multiple reports of the same study, nor does it discuss how inconsistencies across reports were resolved.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides a general description of the article selection and categorization process, including the use of a manual review to determine relevance and the categorization of studies into two main groups.\n- The workflow is summarized in a figure, which gives a high-level overview of the process.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No detail on the number of reviewers, their independence, or the process for data extraction.\n- No description of how disagreements were resolved during data collection.\n- No mention of contacting study authors for clarification or missing data.\n- No use or description of automation tools, translation methods, or data extraction software.\n- No decision rules for handling multiple reports of the same study.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Clearly specify the number of reviewers involved in data extraction and whether they worked independently or in duplicate.\n2. Describe the process for resolving disagreements in data collection (e.g., consensus, third reviewer).\n3. Report any efforts to obtain or confirm data from study authors.\n4. State whether translation was required and, if so, how it was performed.\n5. If automation tools or data extraction software are used, describe their role, training, and validation.\n6. Specify any software used to extract data from figures or images.\n7. Provide decision rules for selecting data from multiple reports and resolving inconsistencies.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe data collection process in this SLR is only minimally addressed. While a general workflow is described, the lack of detail on reviewer roles, data extraction methods, disagreement resolution, translation, and use of automation or software limits transparency and reproducibility. Major improvements are needed to meet best-practice standards for systematic reviews.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The review meets the minimum standard by describing a basic workflow and manual review, but lacks the depth, detail, and transparency required for a higher score. The absence of key methodological details justifies a score of 2/5.', '**SLR Data Items Evaluation**\n\n**Final Score:** 3/5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n### Responsibility 1: Outcome Domains\n1. **Definition and Clarity:** The SLR provides a broad but clear categorization of outcome domains, such as "detection, diagnosis, and self-management techniques of DM" and further breaks these down into facets like datasets, pre-processing, feature extraction, ML/AI techniques, and performance measures. However, the outcome domains are not always defined with precise boundaries or time frames for measurement. There is no explicit prioritization of outcomes as "critical" or "important," nor is there a rationale for such prioritization.\n2. **Seeking and Selection of Results:** The review describes seeking all results compatible with the outcome domains by including 107 studies and summarizing their approaches, features, and performance metrics. Where multiple results are available (e.g., different ML algorithms or features), the process for selecting which results to report is not always transparent or justified. There is some prioritization (e.g., reporting the best-performing algorithm in Table 4), but the selection process is not systematically described.\n3. **Changes and Documentation:** There is no explicit mention of changes to the inclusion or definition of outcome domains during the review process, nor is there documentation of any such changes or their rationale.\n4. **Selection Methods:** Methods for selecting results from eligible studies (e.g., which performance metrics or features to extract) are not fully documented. The review tends to report the most common or best-performing results but does not always explain the selection criteria.\n\n### Responsibility 2: Other Variables\n1. **Listing and Definition:** The SLR provides a comprehensive list of other variables, including participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, type of diabetes), intervention details (e.g., ML/AI technique, feature type), study settings (e.g., dataset source, public vs. self-created), and performance measures (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC). These are explicitly listed in tables and described in the text.\n2. **Assumptions about Missing/Unclear Data:** The review occasionally notes missing or unclear information (e.g., "the age range of the diabetic person is around 20–58 years"), but does not systematically state assumptions or methods for handling missing data. There is no explicit protocol for dealing with unclear or incomplete data items.\n3. **Use of Tools/Frameworks:** There is no mention of using specific tools or frameworks to inform the selection of data items (e.g., for conflicts of interest or intervention documentation).\n4. **Comprehensiveness and Consistency:** The data collection process is generally consistent with the review\'s eligibility criteria and objectives, and most relevant data items are accounted for. However, some variables (e.g., study design, setting, follow-up duration) are not always clearly defined or consistently reported.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides detailed tables and narrative summaries of key data items, including datasets, features, ML/AI techniques, and performance metrics.\n- Most relevant variables are explicitly listed and defined, with clear links to the review objectives.\n- The review seeks to summarize all compatible results within the broad outcome domains.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lack of explicit prioritization or rationale for outcome domains and performance measures.\n- Methods for selecting among multiple results or handling missing/unclear data are not systematically described.\n- No documentation of changes to data items or outcome domains during the review process.\n- Some variables (e.g., study design, setting, follow-up) are inconsistently reported or defined.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Clearly define and prioritize outcome domains, specifying which are "critical" or "important" and providing a rationale.\n2. Systematically document the process for selecting results from eligible studies, especially when multiple results are available.\n3. Explicitly state assumptions and methods for handling missing or unclear data items.\n4. Report any changes to data items or outcome domains during the review process, with justifications.\n5. Consider using established frameworks or tools to guide the selection and reporting of data items.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR addresses most data item requirements with reasonable clarity and comprehensiveness, especially in listing and defining key variables. However, it lacks systematic processes for prioritizing outcomes, selecting among multiple results, and handling missing data. Greater transparency and documentation would improve the rigor and reproducibility of the review.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The review is moderately addressed: it provides substantial detail and coverage of data items but lacks the thoroughness, transparency, and systematic approach required for a higher score. Minor to moderate gaps in prioritization, selection methods, and documentation justify a score of 3/5.', "**Study Risk of Bias Evaluation**\n\n**Final Score:** 0/5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Risk of Bias Tool(s) and Version:**\n   - The SLR does not mention any tool, checklist, or framework (e.g., Cochrane RoB, QUADAS, ROBINS-I, or any custom tool) used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. There is no reference to any version or adaptation of a risk of bias tool.\n\n2. **Reporting of Domains/Components/Items:**\n   - There is no description of the methodological domains, components, or items considered for risk of bias assessment. The review does not discuss any criteria or aspects (e.g., selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, reporting bias) for evaluating the included studies.\n\n3. **Overall Risk of Bias Judgment and Rules:**\n   - The SLR does not report whether an overall risk of bias judgment was made for any included study, nor does it describe any rules or algorithms for summarizing risk across domains or studies.\n\n4. **Adaptations to Existing Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of adapting any existing risk of bias tool, omitting or modifying items, or tailoring a tool to the review context.\n\n5. **Development and Description of New Tools:**\n   - The review does not report developing a new risk of bias tool, nor does it describe the content or public accessibility of any such tool.\n\n6. **Reviewers and Disagreement Resolution:**\n   - There is no information on how many reviewers (if any) assessed risk of bias, whether assessments were performed independently, or how disagreements were resolved.\n\n7. **Contacting Study Investigators:**\n   - The SLR does not report any process for obtaining or confirming risk of bias information from study investigators.\n\n8. **Use of Automation Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of using automation tools (e.g., machine learning models) to assess risk of bias, nor any details on their use, training, or validation.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- None identified. The SLR does not address risk of bias assessment in any form.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Complete absence of any risk of bias assessment or reporting.\n- No mention of tools, domains, reviewer processes, or automation.\n- No transparency or replicability regarding the internal validity of included studies.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Specify and use an established risk of bias tool (e.g., Cochrane RoB, QUADAS, ROBINS-I) appropriate to the study designs included.\n2. Clearly report the domains/components/items assessed for risk of bias.\n3. Describe the process for making overall risk judgments and the rules used.\n4. If adapting or developing a tool, provide a detailed description and make it publicly accessible.\n5. Report the number of reviewers, their independence, and the process for resolving disagreements.\n6. Document any efforts to obtain or confirm information from study authors.\n7. If automation is used, describe the tool, its training, and validation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR does not address risk of bias assessment at all. There is no mention of any tool, process, or results related to evaluating the internal validity of included studies. This is a major methodological omission that undermines the credibility and reliability of the review's findings. Comprehensive risk of bias assessment and transparent reporting are essential for systematic reviews and should be incorporated in future work.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The criterion is entirely absent from the SLR. No elements of risk of bias assessment are present or documented. A score of 0/5 is warranted.", '**Effect Measures Evaluation**\n\n**Final Score:** 2/5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Effect Measures (Essential Element 1):**\n   - The SLR frequently reports performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for machine learning and AI models across included studies. These are presented in summary tables (e.g., Table 4, Table 6) and discussed in the narrative. However, the review does not explicitly define these as "effect measures" or systematically specify which effect measure is used for each outcome or type of outcome. There is no clear mapping of effect measures to specific outcome domains (e.g., detection, diagnosis, self-management), nor is there a rationale for choosing particular measures for particular outcomes.\n\n2. **Thresholds or Ranges for Interpretation (Essential Element 2):**\n   - The review does not state any thresholds or ranges for interpreting the size of effects (e.g., what constitutes a "good" or "poor" accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity). There is no mention of minimally important differences or categories such as "trivial," "small," "moderate," or "large" effects. No rationale is provided for interpreting the magnitude of reported effect measures.\n\n3. **Re-expression of Synthesised Results (Essential Element 3):**\n   - There is no evidence that synthesised results were re-expressed to different effect measures (e.g., converting accuracy to absolute risk reduction, or vice versa). The review reports the effect measures as presented in the original studies, with no documentation of methods for re-expression or transformation.\n\n4. **Justification for Choice of Effect Measures (Additional Element):**\n   - The review does not provide a justification for the choice of effect measures. While it is standard in ML/AI literature to report accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, the review does not explain why these were chosen, nor does it discuss alternatives or the appropriateness of these measures for the various outcome domains.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review consistently reports common performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for included studies, and these are clearly tabulated and summarized.\n- There is some discussion of the relevance of these measures to the review\'s objectives (e.g., evaluating detection and diagnosis performance).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit specification of effect measures for each outcome or outcome type.\n- No thresholds, ranges, or rationale for interpreting the size of effects.\n- No documentation of re-expression or transformation of effect measures.\n- No justification for the choice of effect measures.\n- The reporting is descriptive and lacks the depth and transparency required for reproducibility and interpretability.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Explicitly specify which effect measures are used for each outcome or outcome type, and provide definitions.\n2. State and justify thresholds or ranges for interpreting the size of effects (e.g., what accuracy or AUC is considered clinically meaningful).\n3. If results are re-expressed or transformed, document the methods used.\n4. Provide a rationale for the choice of effect measures, especially if multiple instruments or outcome domains are involved.\n5. Consider including a summary table mapping outcomes to effect measures and interpretation thresholds.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR reports effect measures in a standard, descriptive manner but lacks explicit specification, interpretation thresholds, re-expression documentation, and justification for choice of measures. The review meets the minimum standard by reporting common metrics, but does not address the essential and additional elements with sufficient depth or transparency. Significant improvements are needed to meet best-practice standards for effect measures in systematic reviews.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The review is minimally addressed: effect measures are reported, but not systematically specified, interpreted, or justified. The absence of key elements and rationale justifies a score of 2/5.', '**SLR Synthesis Methods Evaluation**\n\n**Final Score:** 2/5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n### Responsibility 1: Processes Used to Decide Study Eligibility for Each Synthesis\n- The review describes a general process for selecting studies (database search, date restriction, manual review), but does not clearly explain how studies were grouped for each synthesis or how eligibility was determined for specific syntheses (e.g., by intervention, population, or outcome). There is no structured approach to grouping studies for synthesis, nor is there evidence of tabulating or coding main characteristics for synthesis planning. No explicit mention of coding intervention components or using pre-specified criteria for grouping.\n\n### Responsibility 2: Methods to Prepare Data for Presentation or Synthesis\n- The review does not describe any methods for preparing data for synthesis, such as handling missing summary statistics, imputing values, or transforming effect estimates. There is no mention of algebraic manipulations or data conversions. The review simply reports the results as presented in the original studies, with no documentation of data preparation methods or assumptions.\n\n### Responsibility 3: Methods to Tabulate or Visually Display Results\n- The review provides summary tables (e.g., Table 4, Table 6) listing performance metrics and features, and describes the use of tables to present data. However, there is no mention of graphical methods (e.g., forest plots, albatross plots), nor is there a rationale for the chosen tabular structures. The tables are standard and facilitate comparison, but there is no discussion of ordering/grouping within tables or the rationale for their structure. No non-standard graphs are used or justified.\n\n### Responsibility 4: Documentation of Synthesis Methods (Including Meta-Analysis)\n- The review does not report any formal synthesis methods such as meta-analysis. There is no mention of statistical models, methods for quantifying heterogeneity, or software used for synthesis. No rationale is provided for model selection, and no details are given about statistical tools or packages. The review does not explain why meta-analysis or other quantitative synthesis was not performed, nor does it discuss the appropriateness of synthesis methods for the included data.\n\n### Responsibility 5: Methods to Explore Heterogeneity\n- There is no description of methods used to explore heterogeneity among study results. The review does not report subgroup analyses, meta-regression, or any structured exploration of variation across studies. There is no documentation of factors or levels explored, nor any mention of pre-specified or post-hoc analyses for heterogeneity.\n\n### Responsibility 6: Sensitivity Analyses\n- The review does not report any sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of synthesized results. There is no mention of restricting analyses to studies at low risk of bias, using alternative models, or any other form of sensitivity analysis.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides summary tables that facilitate comparison of key data items (e.g., performance metrics, features, algorithms) across studies.\n- The narrative synthesis is structured by topic (datasets, features, ML/AI methods, performance), which aids in understanding the landscape of included studies.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit or transparent documentation of synthesis methods, grouping, or eligibility for synthesis.\n- No description of data preparation, handling of missing data, or transformation of effect estimates.\n- No use or justification of graphical methods for synthesis.\n- No formal synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis), no rationale for synthesis approach, and no reporting of statistical tools or software.\n- No exploration of heterogeneity or sensitivity analyses.\n- Lack of transparency and reproducibility in synthesis methods.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Clearly describe the processes used to group studies for each synthesis, including tabulation and coding of key characteristics.\n2. Report any data preparation methods, including handling of missing data and transformation of effect estimates.\n3. Justify the choice of tabular and graphical methods for presenting results, and consider using standard graphical displays (e.g., forest plots) where appropriate.\n4. If meta-analysis or other quantitative synthesis is not possible, explicitly state the reasons and discuss the implications.\n5. Explore possible causes of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis or meta-regression, and document the methods and findings.\n6. Conduct and report sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of synthesized results.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe synthesis methods in this SLR are minimally addressed. While summary tables and narrative synthesis are provided, there is a lack of explicit, transparent, and systematic documentation of synthesis methods, data preparation, graphical/tabular presentation, exploration of heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses. The review meets the minimum standard by presenting comparative tables and structured narrative, but does not address the essential elements of synthesis methodology required for rigor and reproducibility.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The review is minimally addressed: it provides basic tabular summaries and narrative synthesis, but lacks the depth, transparency, and systematic approach required for a higher score. The absence of formal synthesis methods, data preparation, and exploration of heterogeneity justifies a score of 2/5.', "**Reporting Bias Assessment Evaluation**\n\n**Final Score:** 0/5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Methods to Assess Reporting Bias:**\n   - The SLR does not describe any methods used to assess the risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis (arising from reporting biases). There is no mention of funnel plots, statistical tests for small-study effects, or any other graphical or statistical approaches to detect reporting bias.\n\n2. **Use of Existing Tools:**\n   - There is no indication that any established tool (e.g., ROBIS, Cochrane reporting bias domains) was used to assess reporting bias. No domains, items, or processes for overall judgment are specified.\n\n3. **Adaptations to Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of adapting any existing tool for reporting bias assessment, nor any description of omitted or modified items.\n\n4. **Development of New Tools:**\n   - The review does not report developing or using a new tool to assess risk of reporting bias.

It reports the initial number of records retrieved (DML: 1000, DAI: 1403), the restriction to recent years (DML: 300, DAI: 450), and the results after manual review (DML: 79, DAI: 28), culminating in 107 included studies. A workflow diagram (Fig. 2) is referenced, but not shown in the text provided. There is no explicit mention of duplicate removal, records excluded by automation, or a stepwise breakdown of exclusions at each stage (e.g., after title/abstract screening, full-text review, etc.). The process is described in a general way, but lacks the detailed, stepwise reporting recommended by PRISMA 2020. There is no clear reporting of studies not retrievable, ongoing studies, or use of automation tools.\n\n2. **Reporting of Excluded Studies and Reasons (Responsibility 2):**\n- The review does not provide a list or table of excluded studies that appeared eligible but were excluded, nor does it cite excluded studies with reasons for exclusion. There is no discussion of potentially contentious exclusions or studies that could not be retrieved.

There is no summary table or visual (such as a traffic light plot or risk of bias summary) indicating study-level or domain-level risk of bias judgments.\n\n2. **Justification for Risk of Bias Judgments:**\n- There is no evidence in the text that risk of bias judgments were made for individual studies, nor are there any justifications, quotations, or descriptions from the included studies to support such judgments. The review does not discuss methodological limitations or potential sources of bias in the included studies.\n\n3. **Display of Risk of Bias with Study Results (e.g., Forest Plots):**\n- The review does not present meta-analyses or forest plots, nor does it display risk of bias judgments alongside study results.

Table 4, in particular, lists for each study the classifier(s) used, comparisons, and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC). However, the tables do not consistently present raw summary statistics for each group (e.g., number of participants with/without events, means, SDs, sample sizes) for all outcomes in each study. The focus is on technical and performance outcomes, not on clinical or participant-level summary statistics.\n\n2. **Effect Estimates and Precision:**\n- For each included study, effect estimates are reported in terms of classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, etc.), but precision measures (e.g., standard errors, confidence intervals) are rarely, if ever, provided. Most results are point estimates only. There is no systematic reporting of confidence intervals or credible intervals for effect estimates across studies.\n\n3. **Visual or Tabular Presentation:**\n- Results are presented in tabular format (Tables 1–6), which allows for comparison across studies. There are references to figures (e.g., workflow diagrams), but no forest plots or similar visualizations of individual study results are provided. The tables are structured and facilitate clarity, but the absence of visual plots (such as forest plots) limits the ability to visually compare effect sizes and precision across studies.\n\n4. **Source of Data:**\n- The source of data for each included study is generally reported, especially in Table 1, which lists dataset names, descriptions, URLs, and references. This is a strength of the review, as it allows readers to trace the origin of the data used in each study.\n\n5. **Computed or Estimated Results:**\n- There is no explicit indication in the tables or text as to whether any results were computed or estimated by the review authors (as opposed to being directly reported in the original studies). The review appears to report results as presented in the included studies, but does not specify when/if any calculations or estimations were performed by the reviewers.\n\n**Score: 3/5 (Moderately Addressed)**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Comprehensive tabular presentation of technical and performance results for each included study.\n- Clear reporting of data sources for each study.\n- Performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC) are reported for most studies, facilitating comparison.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lack of raw summary statistics (e.g., event counts, means, SDs, sample sizes) for each group and outcome.\n- Effect estimates are reported as point estimates only, with little or no reporting of precision (confidence intervals, standard errors).\n- No visual presentation of individual study results (e.g., forest plots).\n- No explicit indication of whether results were computed/estimated by the reviewers.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- For each included study, report summary statistics for each group and outcome (e.g., number of events, means, SDs, sample sizes) where appropriate.\n- Include effect estimates with measures of precision (e.g., 95% confidence intervals) for all outcomes, not just point estimates.\n- Present individual study results visually (e.g., forest plots) to facilitate interpretation and comparison.\n- Clearly indicate when results are computed or estimated by the reviewers, and specify the methods used.\n\n**Confirmation of Structured Tables/Plots:**\n- Structured tables are used throughout to present results, but no plots (e.g., forest plots) are provided.\n\n**Final Score:** 3/5 (Moderately Addressed)', 'Evaluation Points:\n\n**Responsibility 1: Evaluation of Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias (for each synthesis):**\n- The review provides detailed tables summarizing datasets, features, algorithms, and performance metrics for included studies (Tables 1–6).

There is no discussion of selective outcome reporting, publication bias, or missing data at the synthesis level.\n\n2. **Use of Tools for Assessing Reporting Bias:**\n- No tool (e.g., ROB-ME, funnel plot, or other reporting bias assessment tool) is used or referenced. There are no responses to tool questions, no judgments about risk of bias, and no supporting evidence provided.\n\n3. **Funnel Plots and Small-Study Effects:**\n- No funnel plots or contour-enhanced funnel plots are presented. There is no mention of effect estimates or measures of precision plotted to assess small-study effects or reporting bias.\n- No statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., Egger's test) are reported.\n\n4. **Sensitivity Analyses for Missing Results:**\n- No sensitivity analyses are conducted or reported to assess the potential impact of missing results on the syntheses. There is no comparison of sensitivity analysis results with primary analyses.\n\n5. **Selective Non-Reporting and Matrix Presentation:**\n- There is no matrix or table showing the availability of study results by outcome or synthesis. There is no discussion of selective non-reporting by comparing pre-specified outcomes with reported results.\n\n6. **Identification and Display of Missing Studies:**\n- There is no identification or display of missing studies beneath forest plots or in tables. No attempt is made to account for or discuss studies that may be missing due to reporting bias.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review is comprehensive in its technical coverage and provides detailed tables of included studies and their technical characteristics.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No assessment or discussion of risk of bias due to missing results is provided.\n- No tools, plots, or sensitivity analyses are used to evaluate reporting bias.\n- No transparency regarding the potential impact of missing results on the syntheses.\n- No evidence that the trustworthiness of the results has been evaluated with respect to reporting bias.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Explicitly assess the risk of bias due to missing results for each synthesis, using an appropriate tool (e.g., ROB-ME or similar).\n- Generate and present funnel plots (and contour-enhanced versions if appropriate) for syntheses with sufficient studies, specifying effect estimates and measures of precision.\n- Conduct and report statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry.\n- Perform and report sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing results.\n- Present a matrix of outcome availability by study and synthesis, and discuss selective non-reporting.\n- Identify and display any missing studies in tables or figures, and discuss their potential impact.\n\n**Final Score:** 0/5 (Not Addressed)\n\n**Confirmation:**\nThe risk of bias due to missing results is not assessed transparently or thoroughly for any synthesis in this review.

There is no use of GRADE or any other formal system to rate the certainty (e.g., high, moderate, low, very low) for the body of evidence supporting each outcome.\n\n2. **Justification for Certainty Ratings:**\n- There are no explanations or footnotes justifying any certainty ratings, as no such ratings are provided. The review does not discuss factors that would lead to rating down or up the certainty of evidence (e.g., risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias).\n\n3. **Communication of Certainty in Evidence at Relevant Points:**\n- Certainty of evidence is not communicated in the abstract, results, evidence summary tables, or conclusions. Standard phrases such as "probably reduces" or "may have little or no effect" are not used. Effect estimates are reported as point estimates (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity), but without any indication of the underlying certainty or confidence in these results.\n\n4. **Use of Evidence Summary Tables (e.g., GRADE SoF):**\n- No GRADE Summary of Findings tables or equivalent are presented. The tables focus on technical performance metrics and do not include certainty ratings or justifications.\n\n5. **Interpretation of Results with Certainty Language:**\n- The review does not use standard language to interpret results in light of certainty (e.g., "probably," "may").

Interpretation of Results in the Context of Other Evidence\n- The discussion provides a general interpretation of the review results, summarizing the findings regarding datasets, features, ML/AI methods, and performance metrics.\n- There is some comparison with other studies, particularly in noting the prevalence of certain datasets and methods, and the relative performance of algorithms (e.g., CNN, SVM, RF). However, explicit, detailed comparison with other systematic reviews or meta-analyses is limited.\n- Discordant results or reasons for differences with other studies are not deeply explored.\n- Additional relevant information such as cost-effectiveness or patient preferences is not discussed.\n\n#### 2. Limitations of the Evidence Included in the Review\n- The discussion acknowledges limitations related to the use of self-created datasets (e.g., limited generalizability, small sample sizes, overfitting/underfitting) and the need for multimodal, larger datasets.\n- There is mention of the need for more precise detection systems and the limitations of current evidence, but the discussion does not systematically address study quality, risk of bias, or missing data in the included studies.\n- The link between these limitations and the certainty/confidence in the evidence is not explicitly referenced.\n\n#### 3. Limitations of the Review Processes Used\n- The discussion does not explicitly address limitations in the review process itself (e.g., search strategy, language restrictions, single reviewer screening, or potential for missed studies).\n- There is a brief mention of the time frame and possible omission of relevant papers due to keyword or database limitations, but this is only noted in the conclusion, not the main discussion.\n- The potential impact of these process limitations on the findings is not discussed.\n\n#### 4. Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Research\n- The discussion addresses implications for future research, highlighting the need for better datasets, optimization techniques, and integration of DL, AI, and cloud computing.\n- Implications for practice and policy are only briefly touched upon (e.g., the value of AI/ML for self-management and personalization), but not discussed in depth.\n- Trade-offs between benefits and harms, and relevance to different stakeholders, are not considered.\n- Recommendations for future research are present and somewhat specific (e.g., need for multimodal datasets, automated optimization, handling inadequate data), but could be more detailed.\n- Contextual factors influencing generalizability are mentioned (e.g., dataset origin, tool variability), but not deeply analyzed.\n\n---\n\n### Strengths\n- The discussion provides a broad summary of findings and highlights key trends in the literature.\n- Some limitations of the evidence (especially regarding datasets) are acknowledged.\n- There is a clear call for future research and identification of ongoing challenges.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- Limited explicit comparison with other systematic reviews or exploration of discordant findings.\n- Insufficient discussion of study quality, risk of bias, and certainty/confidence in the evidence.\n- Minimal acknowledgment of limitations in the review process itself.\n- Implications for practice and policy, as well as trade-offs and stakeholder perspectives, are not thoroughly discussed.\n\n### Suggestions\n- Include a more detailed comparison with other systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and discuss reasons for any differences in findings.\n- Explicitly address the quality and risk of bias of included studies, and link these to the certainty of the review's conclusions.\n- Discuss limitations in the review process (e.g., search strategy, language, reviewer bias) and their potential impact on findings.\n- Expand on the implications for practice and policy, considering different stakeholders and potential trade-offs.\n- Provide more specific recommendations for future research, including study designs, populations, and outcome measures.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\nThe Discussion section moderately addresses the essential items required for a systematic review.

Improvements in these areas would strengthen the discussion considerably.", "**Comparison of the Discussion Section with Other Evidence in the Field of Diabetes Mellitus Detection and Self-Management**\n\n---\n\n### 1. General Interpretation and Comparison with Other Reviews\nThe Discussion section of the reviewed SLR provides a broad summary of findings regarding datasets, features, ML/AI methods, and performance metrics. This is consistent with other recent systematic reviews in the field, such as:\n- **Sun & Zhang (2019, Technicki Vjesnik)**: This review also highlights the predominance of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset and the use of ML algorithms like SVM, RF, and deep learning models for diabetes detection. Both reviews note the importance of feature selection and the growing role of AI in self-management.\n- **Gupta & Chhikara (2018, Procedia Computer Science)**: Similar to the current SLR, this review emphasizes the need for larger, more diverse datasets and the limitations of self-created or single-institution datasets.\n\nHowever, the current SLR's Discussion section does not provide a detailed, explicit comparison with these or other systematic reviews. For example, it does not systematically contrast its findings with those of Sun & Zhang (2019) or discuss areas of agreement or divergence in algorithm performance or dataset utility.\n\n### 2. Exploration of Discordant Results\nOther reviews, such as **Xiong et al. (2018, Frontiers in Physiology)**, have discussed discordant findings in the effectiveness of ML models across different populations and settings, often attributing differences to dataset heterogeneity, feature selection, or model tuning. The current SLR's Discussion section does not deeply explore such discordances or provide possible explanations for differences in findings compared to other studies.\n\n### 3. Additional Relevant Information\nSome recent reviews (e.g., **El-Sappagh et al., 2018, IEEE Access**) have included discussions on cost-effectiveness, patient preferences, and the practical challenges of implementing AI/ML systems in real-world diabetes management. The SLR under review only briefly mentions the value of AI/ML for self-management and personalization, without delving into these broader contextual factors.\n\n### 4. Limitations and Certainty of Evidence\nOther systematic reviews often provide a more structured assessment of study quality, risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence (e.g., using GRADE or similar frameworks). The current SLR's Discussion section acknowledges some limitations (e.g., dataset generalizability, sample size) but does not systematically address risk of bias or certainty/confidence in the evidence, which is a gap compared to best practices in the field.\n\n### 5. Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Research\nWhile the SLR identifies future research needs (e.g., better datasets, optimization techniques), other reviews (such as **Burki, 2015, Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol** and **Donsa et al., 2015, Smart Health**) provide more actionable recommendations for clinical practice, policy, and integration of AI/ML into healthcare systems. The SLR's discussion of these implications is less developed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe Discussion section of the reviewed SLR aligns with other evidence in its identification of key trends and challenges in diabetes mellitus detection and self-management using ML/AI. However, it lacks the depth of comparison, exploration of discordant results, and contextual analysis (e.g., cost, patient preferences, implementation barriers) found in leading systematic reviews in the field. Addressing these gaps would enhance the SLR's contribution and relevance to both research and practice.", '**Score: 3/5**\n\nThis score reflects that the Discussion section is moderately addressed.

There is no dedicated section or declaration addressing this issue.\n2. **Description of Potential Conflicts:** There is no information provided about any financial, professional, or personal relationships that could be perceived as influencing the review findings.\n3. **Management of Competing Interests:** The manuscript does not describe any procedures or steps taken to manage potential conflicts of interest (e.g., exclusion of conflicted authors from certain review tasks).\n4. **Explicit Statement of No Competing Interests:** The paper does not contain a statement such as "The authors declare no competing interests" or any similar disclaimer.\n5. **Transparency and Credibility:** The absence of any competing interests disclosure undermines transparency and does not allow readers to assess the potential for bias in the review process.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review is comprehensive in its technical and methodological coverage of machine learning and AI for diabetes, but this does not extend to transparency about competing interests.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No competing interests statement is present anywhere in the manuscript.\n- No information is provided about how potential conflicts were identified or managed.\n- The paper does not meet any of the PRISMA 2020 requirements for competing interests disclosure.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Include a clear and explicit statement regarding competing interests for all review authors. If none exist, state this directly (e.g., "The authors declare no competing interests.").\n2. If any author has a potential conflict (e.g., financial ties, consulting roles, involvement in included studies), describe the nature of the conflict and how it was managed (e.g., exclusion from risk of bias assessment for their own studies).\n3. Ensure that the competing interests disclosure is included in a dedicated section of the manuscript, following the format recommended by the journal or the ICMJE.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis paper does not address any of the essential requirements for competing interests disclosure. There is a complete lack of information regarding potential conflicts of interest and how they were managed. The manuscript should be revised to include a clear and comprehensive competing interests statement to ensure transparency and maintain the credibility of the review process.', "**Final Score: 0/5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n1. **Template Data Collection Forms:** There is no mention or provision of any data collection templates or forms used in the review. No links or references to such materials are provided.\n2. **Data Extracted from Included Studies:** The paper does not provide any extracted data tables, datasets, or supplementary files containing the data extracted from the included studies. There is no statement about the availability or sharing of such data.\n3. **Data Used for Analyses:** There is no indication that the data used for analyses (e.g., summary tables, meta-analytic datasets) are available, either as supplementary material or in a public repository. No links or references are provided.\n4. **Analytic Code:** The manuscript does not mention the use of analytic code, nor does it provide or reference any code (e.g., scripts for statistical analysis, data processing, or figure generation). There is no statement about code availability or sharing.\n5. **Other Materials:** No other supporting materials (e.g., search strategies, PRISMA checklists, additional figures or tables) are made available or referenced. There is no information about how to access any materials upon request, nor are any author contact details provided for such requests.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review is comprehensive in its coverage of machine learning and AI methods for diabetes detection and management, but this does not extend to transparency or sharing of underlying materials.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No data, code, or supporting materials are made publicly available or referenced.\n- No statement is provided regarding the availability or unavailability of materials.\n- No contact information is given for requesting materials.\n- The paper does not meet any of the PRISMA 2020 requirements for data, code, or materials sharing and transparency.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Deposit all relevant materials (data collection forms, extracted data, analytic code, supplementary tables/figures) in a public repository (e.g., OSF, Dryad, figshare) and provide direct links in the manuscript.\n2. If some materials cannot be shared publicly, provide a clear statement explaining why and include contact details for the responsible author, specifying the conditions under which materials can be requested.\n3. Include a data availability statement in the manuscript, even if no materials are available, to clarify the situation for readers.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis paper does not address any of the essential requirements for data, code, or materials sharing. There is a complete lack of information regarding the availability of underlying materials, which undermines transparency, reproducibility, and the potential for reuse or verification of the review's findings. The manuscript should be revised to include a clear data and materials availability statement and, where possible, provide access to all relevant materials."]}}
