The rationale and objectives are clearly defined, contributing valuable insights for practitioners in the field. Strengths include clear research questions and a robust justification for the review, while minor areas for improvement were noted in both sections regarding adherence to established frameworks and deeper exploration of uncertainties. Overall, the review appears valuable and well-constructed.', 'per_agent_result': ['**Evaluation of the Rationale Section**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n1. **Current State of Knowledge and Uncertainties:** The introduction and rationale provide a broad overview of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within it. The authors discuss the technological advances driving I4.0, the emergence of smart manufacturing, and the increasing adoption of AI across various sectors. They highlight that while AI is widely adopted, its implementation and challenges vary by industry. The rationale identifies a gap in understanding how different industries utilize AI for I4.0, the concerns they face, and the solutions they develop. \n\n2. **Importance of Conducting the Review:** The authors state that previous reviews have not comprehensively covered AI-based methodologies across different industry sectors, nor have they sufficiently addressed the specific concerns and solutions encountered in these sectors. They position their review as filling this gap and providing value to practitioners and decision-makers.\n\n3. **Existing Reviews and Need for This Review:** The rationale references several previous studies and reviews (e.g., Bertolini et al., 2021; Dalenogare et al., 2018; Lee & Lim, 2021; Meindl et al., 2021), noting that these works either focus narrowly on machine learning or do not address cross-sectoral applications and challenges. The authors explicitly state that their review complements broader reviews by focusing on sector-specific applications and challenges, thus justifying the need for their work.\n\n4. **Update or Replication:** There is no indication that this review is an update or replication of a previous review. The authors position it as a novel synthesis.\n\n5. **Intervention Mechanism (if applicable):** The review is not about a specific intervention but about the application of AI in I4.0. The rationale does describe, at a high level, how AI technologies are expected to work within the I4.0 context (e.g., data collection, processing, model construction, and interpretation).\n\n6. **Logic Model or Conceptual Framework:** The rationale introduces the concept of an "AI adoption pipeline" (data collection, processing, model construction, interpretation) as a framework for organizing the review. This serves as a conceptual framework, though it is not presented as a detailed logic model.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clearly identifies a gap in the literature and justifies the need for the review.\n- References existing reviews and explains how this review differs and adds value.\n- Provides a conceptual framework (the AI adoption pipeline) for organizing the review.\n- Articulates the practical importance for industry practitioners and decision-makers.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The rationale could be more explicit in describing the specific uncertainties or controversies in the field.\n- The discussion of the conceptual framework is brief and could be expanded with a visual or more detailed logic model.\n- The rationale does not explicitly mention if the review is an update or replication, but this is a minor issue given the novelty claim.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Expand on the specific uncertainties or debates in the field to strengthen the rationale.\n- Include a visual logic model or more detailed conceptual framework to clarify the hypothesized relationships between AI components and outcomes in I4.0.\n- Briefly mention the process for identifying and evaluating existing reviews to further justify the need for this review.\n\n**Score:** 4/5\n\n**Summary:**\nThe rationale section is adequately addressed, providing a clear justification for the review in the context of existing knowledge, referencing prior work, and introducing a conceptual framework. Minor improvements could be made by elaborating on uncertainties and providing a more detailed logic model. Overall, the rationale is strong and well-aligned with PRISMA 2020 standards.', '**Evaluation of the Objectives Section**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n1. **Explicit Statement of Objectives/Questions:** The objectives of the review are clearly stated in the introduction and early sections of the paper. The authors present three research questions (RQs):\n   - RQ1: What are the concerns that current IAI techniques address in I4.0?\n   - RQ2: Which IAI techniques are used to address which concerns?\n   - RQ3: What are the challenges to the adoption of current IAI technologies in I4.0?\n   These questions are explicit, focused, and directly guide the scope of the review.\n\n2. **Clarity and Scope:** The objectives are articulated in a way that helps readers understand the scope of the review. The paper further elaborates on the contributions, which align with the RQs and clarify the intended outcomes (e.g., identifying concerns, associating technologies, surveying approaches, and distilling challenges).\n\n3. **Alignment with Relevant Frameworks:** The objectives are organized around an "AI adoption pipeline" (data collection, processing, model construction, interpretation), which serves as a conceptual framework for the review. However, the objectives are not explicitly formulated using a standard question formulation framework such as PICO, PICOS, or PICOT. This is understandable given the review\'s focus on applications and challenges rather than intervention effects, but it is a limitation in terms of strict adherence to PRISMA guidance.\n\n4. **Specificity (PICO or Variant):** The objectives do not specify population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO), nor do they use a variant. Instead, they are structured around thematic concerns and technological solutions. While this is appropriate for a review of applications and challenges, it does not fully meet the criterion for expressing objectives in terms of a relevant question formulation framework.\n\n5. **Link to Methods:** The objectives are sufficiently clear to allow assessment of whether the methods (eligibility criteria, search, data extraction, synthesis) are appropriate to address them. The review\'s structure and methodology are well-aligned with the stated objectives.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Objectives are clearly and explicitly stated as research questions.\n- The scope and intended contributions are well-defined and transparent.\n- The use of an "AI adoption pipeline" provides a conceptual structure for the review.\n- The objectives are well-aligned with the review\'s methods and synthesis.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The objectives are not expressed using a standard question formulation framework (e.g., PICO), which is a minor limitation for systematic reviews.\n- The alignment with frameworks is more conceptual (the AI pipeline) than methodological (PICO or similar).\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Consider mapping the objectives to a recognized question formulation framework, even if adapted for technology reviews (e.g., specifying the population as industry sectors, interventions as AI techniques, outcomes as addressed concerns/challenges).\n- Make explicit in the objectives section how the AI adoption pipeline framework structures the review questions and synthesis.\n\n**Score:** 4/5\n\n**Summary:**\nThe objectives section is adequately addressed, with clear and explicit research questions that define the scope and direction of the review. The use of an "AI adoption pipeline" provides a useful conceptual framework, though the objectives are not expressed in terms of a standard question formulation framework such as PICO. Minor improvements could be made by mapping the objectives to such a framework for greater methodological rigor. Overall, the objectives are strong and well-aligned with PRISMA 2020 standards for non-intervention reviews.']}, 3: {'overall_result': '## Overall Score: 1.4/5\n---\n\n*SLR Eligibility Criteria Evaluation Agent*  \n*Score: 2/5*  \n*Summarized Feedback*: The paper fails to define key elements such as population and intervention clearly.

The process for handling multiple results or changes to outcome definitions is not documented.\n- The review does not specify which outcomes are considered "critical" or "important" for the review’s conclusions, nor does it provide a rationale for such prioritization.\n\n**Responsibility 2: Other Variables**\n- The paper lists some variables such as industry sector, AI/ML approach, and application domain, but does not provide explicit definitions or a comprehensive list of all data items collected (e.g., participant characteristics, intervention details, study settings, funding sources).\n- There is no clear statement of assumptions made about missing or unclear information, nor is there mention of tools or frameworks used to inform the selection of data items.\n- The data collection process is described in general terms, but the specific data items and their definitions are not transparently reported or linked to the eligibility criteria.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review identifies broad categories of interest (e.g., data pipeline stages, industry sectors, AI/ML techniques) and attempts to organize findings accordingly.\n- There is some discussion of the types of concerns addressed in the literature (e.g., data quality, security, skill shortage), which provides context for the data items considered.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lack of explicit, structured definitions for outcome domains and other key data items.\n- No documentation of processes for selecting among multiple results, prioritizing outcomes, or handling changes to data items.\n- No comprehensive list or table of data items collected, nor clear linkage to review objectives or eligibility criteria.\n- No mention of handling missing data, assumptions, or use of frameworks/tools for data item selection.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Clearly define all outcome domains, including time frames and measurement criteria, and specify which are critical or important for the review’s conclusions.\n- Provide a comprehensive list of all data items collected (e.g., study characteristics, participant details, intervention/exposure, outcomes, funding), with explicit definitions.\n- Document the process for selecting among multiple results within studies, including any prioritization or hierarchy.\n- State any assumptions made about missing or unclear data, and describe how such cases are handled.\n- If any frameworks or tools were used to inform data item selection, cite and describe them.\n- Consider including a summary table of all data items and their definitions for transparency and reproducibility.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\nThe data items section is minimally addressed. While the review organizes findings by broad categories and discusses some relevant variables, it lacks explicit definitions, comprehensive reporting, and transparent processes for data item selection and prioritization.

There is no mention of any tool, process, or results related to risk of bias in the included studies. This is a major limitation, as risk of bias assessment is a critical component of systematic reviews for evaluating the credibility and reliability of included evidence.

There is no mention of statistical effect measures such as risk ratios, mean differences, odds ratios, standardized mean differences, or any other quantitative summary statistics typically used in systematic reviews.\n2. **Thresholds or Ranges for Interpreting Effect Size:**\n   - There is no documentation of thresholds, ranges, or criteria for interpreting the size of effects (e.g., minimally important difference, or categories such as small/moderate/large effect). No rationale or justification for any such thresholds is provided.\n3. **Re-expression of Synthesized Results:**\n   - The review does not report any re-expression of synthesized results to alternative effect measures (e.g., converting relative to absolute effects, or vice versa). No methods for such re-expression are described.\n4. **Justification for Choice of Effect Measures:**\n   - There is no justification or discussion regarding the choice of effect measures. The review is largely qualitative and descriptive, focusing on thematic synthesis and categorization of concerns, applications, and challenges, rather than quantitative effect estimation.\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides a broad thematic synthesis and categorization of concerns and solutions in the application of AI in Industry 4.0, which may be appropriate for the largely qualitative and scoping nature of the review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No effect measures are specified, described, or justified for any outcome or synthesis group.\n- No thresholds or interpretive criteria for effect size are provided.\n- No methods for re-expressing or translating effect measures are reported.\n- The absence of effect measures limits the ability to interpret the magnitude or importance of findings, and precludes quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- If quantitative synthesis is not feasible, explicitly state this and provide a rationale (e.g., heterogeneity, lack of data).\n- For future reviews, specify effect measures for each outcome or type of outcome, even if only for descriptive purposes (e.g., frequency, proportion, mean, or qualitative effect size).\n- If thresholds or interpretive criteria are used, state them clearly and provide a rationale.\n- If results are re-expressed (e.g., from relative to absolute terms), describe the methods used.\n- Provide a justification for the choice of effect measures, especially if multiple types of outcomes or measurement instruments are included.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\nThe effect measures section is not addressed at all. The review does not specify, justify, or interpret any effect measures for outcomes, nor does it provide thresholds or methods for re-expressing results. This is a major limitation for transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility, especially if quantitative synthesis is intended. The section would benefit from explicit specification and justification of effect measures in line with PRISMA 2020 and best practice standards.', '**Evaluation of SLR Synthesis Methods Section**\n\n**Final Score:** 2 out of 5\n\n---\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n**Responsibility 1: Eligibility for Each Synthesis**\n- The review describes a general process for grouping studies by industry sector and by stages in an "IAI data pipeline" (data acquisition, processing, model construction, model interpretation). However, the process for deciding which studies were eligible for each synthesis is not clearly described. There is no detailed reporting of how studies were grouped for synthesis beyond broad thematic categories, and no structured coding or tabulation of study characteristics is provided. Grouping appears to be based on emergent themes rather than pre-specified criteria.\n\n**Responsibility 2: Data Preparation Methods**\n- The review does not report any specific methods for preparing data for synthesis. There is no mention of handling missing data, transforming effect estimates, or performing algebraic manipulations. The synthesis is qualitative and thematic, so such methods may not be applicable, but this is not explicitly stated or justified.\n\n**Responsibility 3: Tabulation and Visual Display**\n- The review presents several summary tables (e.g., Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7) that list studies by category, concern, or application. However, the methods for constructing these tables, the rationale for ordering/grouping, and the choice of data presented are not described. No graphical methods (e.g., forest plots, albatross plots) are used, and the rationale for tabular presentation is not discussed. The tables do facilitate some transparency and pattern identification, but the approach is not systematically reported.\n\n**Responsibility 4: Synthesis Methods (Meta-analysis, Heterogeneity, Software)**\n- The review does not perform any quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis. There is no mention of statistical models, heterogeneity assessment, or software used for synthesis. The review is entirely qualitative and thematic. The absence of quantitative synthesis is not explicitly justified (e.g., due to heterogeneity or lack of data), though the narrative suggests that heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes precluded meta-analysis.\n\n**Responsibility 5: Exploration of Heterogeneity**\n- No formal methods (e.g., subgroup analysis, meta-regression) are used to explore heterogeneity. The review discusses differences across industry sectors and application domains narratively, but does not systematically explore or document sources of heterogeneity.\n\n**Responsibility 6: Sensitivity Analyses**\n- No sensitivity analyses are reported or described. There is no discussion of robustness checks, alternative syntheses, or exclusion of studies at high risk of bias (noting also that risk of bias was not assessed).\n\n---\n**Strengths:**\n- The review organizes findings by broad thematic categories (industry sector, data pipeline stage) and presents summary tables to aid understanding.\n- The narrative synthesis highlights similarities and differences across sectors and applications, which is appropriate for a scoping or mapping review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit, structured methods for grouping studies for synthesis or for preparing data.\n- No quantitative synthesis, and the absence of such is not explicitly justified.\n- No formal exploration of heterogeneity or sensitivity analyses.\n- Methods for tabulation and presentation are not described or justified.\n- No use of software or statistical tools for synthesis.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Clearly describe the process for grouping studies for synthesis, including any coding or tabulation of study characteristics.\n- If only qualitative synthesis is feasible, explicitly state the reasons (e.g., heterogeneity, lack of data) and describe the approach used.\n- Provide a rationale for the choice of tabular or graphical methods, and describe how tables were constructed and studies grouped.\n- Consider formal methods for exploring heterogeneity, even in qualitative syntheses (e.g., subgrouping by key characteristics).\n- If sensitivity analyses are not performed, state this and provide a rationale.\n- For future reviews, consider whether any quantitative synthesis is possible, and if so, report the methods and software used in detail.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\nThe synthesis methods section is only partially addressed. While the review provides a broad thematic synthesis and uses summary tables, it lacks explicit, structured methods for grouping studies, preparing data, and presenting results. There is no quantitative synthesis, no formal exploration of heterogeneity, and no sensitivity analyses.

There is no table or appendix that systematically presents all outcomes for all included studies.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. **Present Study-Level Results:** For each included study and outcome, report summary statistics (e.g., means, SDs, sample sizes for continuous outcomes; number of events and total for dichotomous outcomes) in a structured table.\n2. **Report Effect Estimates and Precision:** For each study, provide effect estimates (e.g., risk ratios, mean differences) and their precision (e.g., 95% CI), even if no meta-analysis is performed.\n3. **Use Visual Summaries:** Include forest plots or similar visualizations to display individual study results and their confidence intervals.\n4. **Specify Data Sources:** Clearly indicate the source of each data point (e.g., published article, registry, author contact) and note if any results were computed or estimated by the reviewers.\n5. **Comprehensive Tabular Presentation:** Create a unified table that presents all individual study results for all outcomes, facilitating comparison and transparency.\n\n---\n\n**Confirmation of Structured Tables/Plots:**\n- The SLR uses structured tables to present some information about individual studies, but these do not include summary statistics, effect estimates, or measures of precision. No forest plots or equivalent visualizations are provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reporting of individual study results in this SLR is only partially addressed. While there are tables listing studies and some narrative synthesis, the essential elements required for transparent and reusable reporting of individual study results—such as summary statistics, effect estimates, precision measures, and clear data sourcing—are missing. The authors should revise the reporting to include these elements, following PRISMA 2020 guidance, to ensure clarity, transparency, and reusability of the review's findings.\n\n**Final Score: 2/5 (Partially Addressed)**", "**Evaluation Points**\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides a broad narrative synthesis of findings, organized by thematic categories (e.g., data acquisition, processing, model training, model interpretation) and industry sectors.\n- Several summary tables (Tables 3–7) list studies by author, industry focus, and concern addressed, which allows for some mapping of studies to synthesis themes.\n- The review discusses common concerns, challenges, and solutions across studies, and attempts to group findings by pipeline stage and sector.\n\n---\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias (Responsibility 1):**\n  - There is no explicit, structured summary of the characteristics and risk of bias for studies contributing to each synthesis. While some tables list studies and concerns, essential characteristics (e.g., study design, population, setting, outcomes) and risk of bias are not systematically summarized or discussed for each synthesis.\n  - The studies included in each synthesis are not always explicitly listed; tables are fragmented and do not clearly map studies to each synthesis result.\n  - There is no mention or documentation of risk of bias for studies contributing to each synthesis, nor is there a summary of how risk of bias might affect the synthesized results.\n\n- **Statistical Synthesis Results (Responsibility 2):**\n  - No statistical syntheses (e.g., meta-analyses) are conducted or reported. There are no summary estimates, measures of precision, or heterogeneity statistics.\n  - The direction of effect, effect sizes, and units of measurement are not reported for any quantitative synthesis. There is no mention of standardized mean differences, summary effect estimates, or confidence intervals.\n  - Results are presented narratively and in basic tables, but without quantitative synthesis or statistical rigor.\n\n- **Heterogeneity Investigations (Responsibility 3):**\n  - There are no formal or informal investigations of heterogeneity among study results. No subgroup analyses, meta-regressions, or tests of interaction are reported.\n  - There is no identification of studies contributing to subgroups or any presentation of estimates for differences between subgroups.\n\n- **Sensitivity Analyses (Responsibility 4):**\n  - No sensitivity analyses are conducted or reported. There are no tables or forest plots presenting sensitivity analysis results, nor any commentary on the robustness of the main findings.\n\n- **General:**\n  - The synthesis is almost entirely narrative and thematic, lacking the essential elements of structured, transparent, and quantitative synthesis required by PRISMA 2020.\n  - There is no clear mapping of which studies contribute to which synthesis results, nor any documentation of the applicability or limitations of the evidence base for each synthesis.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. **Summarize Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias for Each Synthesis:** For each synthesis (thematic or quantitative), provide a brief summary of the contributing studies' key characteristics and risk of bias, and list the studies explicitly.\n2. **Report Statistical Synthesis Results:** If meta-analyses are not feasible, at least provide summary effect estimates, direction of effect, and measures of precision for key outcomes where possible.\n3. **Investigate and Report Heterogeneity:** Conduct and report subgroup analyses or meta-regressions where appropriate, or at least discuss potential sources of heterogeneity among included studies.\n4. **Conduct Sensitivity Analyses:** Perform and report sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the main findings, and present results in tables or plots.\n5. **Use Structured Tables and Visualizations:** Present synthesis results in structured tables and, where possible, forest plots or other visual summaries to enhance transparency and interpretability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe synthesis of study results in this SLR is minimally addressed. While there is a broad narrative and thematic grouping of findings, the essential elements of structured, transparent, and quantitative synthesis—including study characteristics, risk of bias, statistical results, heterogeneity investigations, and sensitivity analyses—are almost entirely absent. The review would benefit greatly from adopting PRISMA 2020 guidance for reporting synthesis results, including structured tables, explicit mapping of studies to syntheses, and quantitative summaries where possible.\n\n**Final Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**", "**Evaluation Points**\n\n**Score: 0/5 (Not Addressed)**\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR acknowledges, in a general sense, the existence of reporting bias and missing data as concerns in industrial AI applications (e.g., mentions of data quality, model bias, and lack of data in narrative sections and tables).\n- There is some recognition that data availability and selective reporting are issues in the field, particularly in the context of industrial datasets and applications.\n\n---\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **No Structured Assessment of Reporting Bias:** The SLR does not present any structured or systematic assessment of the risk of bias due to missing results (reporting biases) in any synthesis or for any included studies.\n- **No Use of Tools or Frameworks:** There is no mention of any tool, checklist, or framework (e.g., ROB-ME, funnel plot analysis, or other methods) used to assess reporting bias.\n- **No Funnel Plots or Small-Study Effect Analyses:** The review does not present any funnel plots, contour-enhanced funnel plots, or statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry to evaluate small-study effects or publication bias.\n- **No Sensitivity Analyses for Missing Results:** There are no sensitivity analyses conducted or reported to assess the potential impact of missing results on the syntheses. No comparison of primary and sensitivity analyses is provided.\n- **No Matrix or Table of Selective Non-Reporting:** The SLR does not present a matrix or table showing the availability of study results across syntheses, nor does it display missing studies beneath forest plots or in summary tables.\n- **No Discussion of Impact:** There is no discussion of how missing results or reporting bias might affect the trustworthiness or interpretation of the review's findings.\n- **No Transparency:** The methods and results sections do not provide any information that would allow readers to judge the risk of bias due to missing results.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. **Conduct and Report a Structured Assessment:** Use a recognized tool or framework (e.g., ROB-ME) to assess the risk of bias due to missing results for each synthesis and present the findings in a structured table or narrative.\n2. **Present Funnel Plots and Statistical Tests:** If quantitative syntheses are performed, generate and present funnel plots (and contour-enhanced versions if appropriate), specifying effect estimates and measures of precision. Report results of tests for funnel plot asymmetry.\n3. **Perform Sensitivity Analyses:** Conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing results on the main findings, and compare these with the primary analyses.\n4. **Report Selective Non-Reporting:** Present a matrix or table showing which studies contributed results to each synthesis and which did not, with reasons where possible.\n5. **Discuss Impact on Findings:** Explicitly discuss how the risk of reporting bias and missing results may affect the confidence in and interpretation of the review's conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Confirmation of Transparent and Thorough Assessment:**\n- The risk of bias due to missing results (reporting bias) is **not** assessed transparently or thoroughly for any synthesis in this SLR. There is no evidence of any structured approach, tool use, or reporting of relevant analyses.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR does not address the risk of bias due to missing results (reporting bias) in any structured, transparent, or systematic way. There are no assessments, tools, plots, or sensitivity analyses presented, and no discussion of the potential impact of missing results on the syntheses. This is a major omission, as reporting bias can significantly affect the trustworthiness of systematic review findings. The authors should revise the review to include a comprehensive assessment of reporting bias, following PRISMA 2020 and best practice guidance.\n\n**Final Score: 0/5 (Not Addressed)**", '**Evaluation Points**\n\n**Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR acknowledges, in a general sense, the existence of concerns related to data quality, bias, and challenges in model training and interpretation (e.g., mentions of model bias, lack of data, and data linking in Table 6 and some narrative sections).\n- There is some recognition of the importance of data quality and bias in the context of industrial AI applications, and the discussion of limitations and challenges (e.g., data availability, skill shortage, data security, return on investment, and passive mindset) is present in the narrative.\n- The review attempts to group findings by thematic categories and pipeline stages, which could provide a structure for certainty assessment if further developed.\n\n---\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **No Explicit Certainty of Evidence Assessment:** The SLR does not systematically assess or report the certainty of evidence for any outcome or synthesis. There is no use of a recognized framework (e.g., GRADE) to rate the certainty of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n- **No Justification for Certainty Judgments:** There are no explicit explanations or footnotes justifying any certainty ratings (e.g., for risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias).\n- **No Summary of Findings Table:** There are no GRADE Summary of Findings tables or equivalent evidence summary tables that present certainty levels for each outcome.\n- **No Communication of Certainty in Results or Conclusions:** The certainty of evidence is not communicated in the abstract, results, or conclusions, nor is it bracketed alongside effect estimates or outcome statements (e.g., "probably reduces," "may have little or no effect").\n- **No Standard Phrasing:** The review does not use standard phrases to communicate certainty (e.g., "probably reduces," "may increase") in the interpretation of results.\n- **No Outcome-Specific Assessment:** There is no outcome-by-outcome assessment of certainty, nor any discussion of how certainty in the evidence affects the reliability or interpretation of the review\'s conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. **Adopt a Certainty Assessment Framework:** Use a recognized system such as GRADE to assess and report the certainty of evidence for each important outcome or synthesis.\n2. **Provide Justifications:** For each certainty rating, provide clear explanations for rating down or up (e.g., for risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias), ideally as footnotes in a summary table.\n3. **Create Summary of Findings Tables:** Present certainty levels for each outcome in a structured table, with effect estimates and explanations.\n4. **Communicate Certainty in Text:** Use standard phrases to communicate certainty in the evidence at relevant points (e.g., "AI-enabled processes probably improve predictive maintenance accuracy").\n5. **Discuss Impact on Conclusions:** Explicitly discuss how the certainty of evidence affects the strength and reliability of the review\'s conclusions and recommendations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe certainty of evidence is minimally addressed in this SLR. While there is some narrative recognition of data quality and bias issues, there is no structured, transparent, or outcome-specific assessment of certainty. The review does not use any formal framework (such as GRADE), does not provide justifications for certainty judgments, and does not communicate certainty in the results or conclusions. The authors should revise the review to include a comprehensive certainty of evidence assessment for each outcome, following established guidelines and best practices.\n\n**Final Score: 1/5 (Minimally Addressed)**']}, 5: {'overall_result': "## Overall Score: 3/5\n---\n\n*Discussion Evaluator*\n*Score: 3/5*\n*Summarized Feedback*: The Discussion section is moderately comprehensive, addressing most essential items but lacking depth in comparison with other evidence, systematic discussion of limitations, and detailed implications analysis.

Interpretation of Results in the Context of Other Evidence\n- The discussion provides some comparison with other reviews and studies, especially in the introduction and throughout the findings, referencing how this review complements broader reviews (e.g., Meindl et al., 2021) and fills gaps left by previous work. However, explicit, in-depth comparison of findings with other systematic reviews or meta-analyses is limited. Discordant results or reasons for differences are not deeply explored. Cost-effectiveness and patient (or stakeholder) preferences are only briefly mentioned in the context of return on investment and skill shortages, but not systematically discussed.\n\n#### 2. Limitations of the Evidence Included in the Review\n- The limitations of the included evidence are discussed, particularly regarding the focus on journal articles indexed in Scopus and Google Scholar, exclusion of gray literature, and the technological focus (Section 4). The discussion acknowledges that managerial, social, and governance aspects are only partially covered. There is mention of issues such as data quality, sample size, and risk of bias in the context of industrial data, but these are not systematically tied to the certainty or confidence in the evidence. The limitations are referenced in relation to the results, but the discussion could be more explicit in connecting these limitations to the interpretation of findings.\n\n#### 3. Limitations of the Review Processes Used\n- The review process limitations are addressed, including language restrictions, database selection, and exclusion of non-journal literature. The potential impact of these limitations is acknowledged, especially regarding the possible omission of practitioner-reported issues and the narrow technological focus. However, the discussion does not provide a detailed assessment of how these process limitations might have affected the validity or completeness of the review. There is some recognition of the potential for missing relevant studies, but the implications are not deeply analyzed.\n\n#### 4. Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Research\n- The discussion provides a reasonably clear account of the implications for practice and policy, especially regarding the adoption of AI in Industry 4.0, challenges such as data availability, skill shortages, and return on investment. Recommendations for future research are present, including the need for generalized frameworks, further research into skill sets and technology requirements, and the importance of trust and ethics in AI. The discussion considers contextual factors (e.g., industry-specific vs. generalizable solutions) and the need for further research in underexplored areas. However, the trade-offs between benefits and harms are not deeply explored, and recommendations for future research, while present, could be more specific.\n\n---\n\n### Strengths\n- The discussion is comprehensive in identifying and summarizing key challenges, opportunities, and future research directions.\n- Limitations of the evidence and review process are acknowledged.\n- Implications for practice and policy are discussed, with some attention to contextual factors and the need for generalizable frameworks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- Limited explicit comparison with other systematic reviews or meta-analyses; discordant findings are not deeply explored.\n- Discussion of limitations could be more systematically tied to the certainty/confidence in the evidence.\n- The impact of review process limitations on findings is not deeply analyzed.\n- Trade-offs between benefits and harms, and stakeholder preferences, are not thoroughly discussed.\n\n### Suggestions\n- Provide a more explicit and systematic comparison of findings with other reviews and studies, including discussion of discordant results and possible reasons for differences.\n- More clearly tie the limitations of the evidence to the certainty/confidence in the findings, referencing any formal assessments if available.\n- Analyze in greater depth how review process limitations may have affected the validity and completeness of the review.\n- Discuss trade-offs between benefits and harms, and consider stakeholder preferences more thoroughly in the implications section.\n- Offer more specific recommendations for future research, including targeted study designs, populations, or interventions.\n\n---\n**Summary:**\nThe Discussion section is moderately comprehensive, addressing most essential items but lacking depth in comparison with other evidence, systematic discussion of limitations, and detailed implications analysis. Improvements in these areas would strengthen the review\'s contribution and utility for practitioners and researchers.']}, 6: {'overall_result': '## Overall Score: 1.75/5\n---\n\n*Registration and Protocol Evaluator*\n*Score: 0/5*\n*Summarized Feedback*: This paper does not address any of the PRISMA 2020 requirements for registration, protocol access, or amendment documentation.

However, it does not address non-financial support or clarify the role of the funders or sponsors in the review process. To fully meet PRISMA 2020 standards and ensure transparency, the authors should explicitly state the role of funders and any non-financial support received.', '**Final Score: 3/5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n- **Declaration of Competing Interests:** The paper includes a clear statement in the "Declaration of Competing Interest" section: "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper." This is a standard and appropriate declaration for systematic reviews.\n- **Transparency and Specificity:** The statement is generic and does not provide any author-specific details or disclosures beyond the standard wording. There is no mention of the use of a formal disclosure form (e.g., ICMJE), nor is there a description of the process by which competing interests were assessed among the author group.\n- **Management of Competing Interests:** There is no explicit description of how potential competing interests (if any) would have been managed during the review process (e.g., exclusion from certain review tasks, risk of bias assessment, or data extraction for studies in which an author may have been involved). However, since the authors declare no known competing interests, this may not have been necessary.\n- **Coverage of Non-Financial Interests:** The statement covers both financial and personal relationships but does not explicitly address other potential non-financial competing interests (such as academic, professional, or intellectual conflicts).\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper provides a clear and unambiguous statement that the authors have no known competing interests.\n- The declaration is placed in a dedicated section, enhancing transparency for readers.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The statement is generic and does not provide author-specific details or describe the process for assessing or managing potential conflicts.\n- There is no mention of the use of a formal disclosure form or process.\n- The statement does not explicitly address all possible types of competing interests (e.g., academic or intellectual).\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- For enhanced transparency, specify whether all authors completed a formal disclosure form (such as the ICMJE form) and whether any potential conflicts were discussed and managed.\n- If any author had a potential competing interest, describe how this was managed (e.g., exclusion from certain review tasks).\n- Consider explicitly stating that all types of competing interests (financial, academic, professional, intellectual) were considered.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe paper meets the basic requirements for competing interests disclosure by providing a clear statement that no known competing interests exist. However, it does not provide details on the process for assessing or managing potential conflicts, nor does it address all possible types of competing interests. To fully meet best practice standards and PRISMA 2020 requirements, the authors should provide more detail on the process and scope of their competing interests assessment.', '**Final Score: 1/5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n- **Template Data Collection Forms:** There is no mention in the manuscript of any data collection templates or forms being made available, nor is there a statement about their availability upon request.\n- **Extracted Data from Included Studies:** The paper does not provide any extracted data tables, supplementary files, or links to repositories containing the data extracted from the included studies. There is no statement about the availability of such data.\n- **Data Used for Analyses:** There is no indication that the data used for analyses (e.g., summary tables, coded variables, or datasets) are available, either as supplementary material or in a public repository. The paper does not mention whether these materials can be requested from the authors.\n- **Analytic Code:** There is no reference to analytic code (e.g., scripts for data processing, analysis, or visualization) being available, nor any mention of the software or code used in the review process.\n- **Other Materials:** No other supporting materials (such as search strategies, PRISMA checklists, or additional documentation) are provided or referenced as being available.\n- **Accessibility Information:** There are no links to public repositories (e.g., OSF, Dryad, figshare, SRDR) or statements about how to access any materials upon request. The only related statement is in the "Data availability" section: "No data was used for the research described in the article." This suggests that the authors did not generate or use any new datasets, but it does not address the availability of review materials (e.g., extracted data, code, forms) that are expected for transparency and reproducibility in systematic reviews.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper includes a "Data availability" statement, which clarifies that no new data was used. This provides some transparency about the data generation aspect of the review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No materials related to the review (data collection forms, extracted data, analytic code, or other supporting materials) are made publicly available or offered upon request.\n- There is no mention of public repositories or supplementary files.\n- The statement "No data was used for the research described in the article" is insufficient for a systematic review, as it does not address the expectation to share review materials (e.g., extracted data, code, forms) for reproducibility.\n- No contact information is provided for requesting materials, nor is there an explanation for why materials are not available.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Make available, at minimum, the data extraction forms, extracted data, and analytic code used in the review, either as supplementary files or in a public repository (e.g., OSF, Dryad, figshare).\n- If materials cannot be made publicly available, provide a clear statement explaining why, and include contact details for the responsible author so that materials can be requested under appropriate conditions.\n- Even if no new data were generated, the review process itself produces materials (e.g., lists of included/excluded studies, coding sheets, search strategies) that should be shared for transparency and reproducibility.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe paper does not meet PRISMA 2020 requirements for data, code, and materials availability. No review materials are made available, and the only statement provided is that no data was used, which does not address the need for transparency in systematic reviews. To improve, the authors should share all relevant review materials or provide a clear rationale and contact information for access upon request.']}}
