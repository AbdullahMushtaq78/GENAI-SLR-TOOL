The abstract, in particular, lacks critical components outlined in the PRISMA guidelines, which impacts its effectiveness.\n---', 'per_agent_result': ['Title under evaluation: "Customer attitudes towards online shopping: A systematic review of the influencing factors"\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Identification as a Systematic Review:**\n   - The title explicitly includes the phrase "A systematic review," which clearly identifies the report as a systematic review. This meets the requirement for transparency and specificity.\n\n2. **Informative Description of Main Objective/Question:**\n   - The title states the main focus: "Customer attitudes towards online shopping" and specifies that the review is about "the influencing factors." This provides a general sense of the objective, which is to synthesize evidence on what factors influence customer attitudes toward online shopping.\n\n3. **Inclusion of Key Components (Population, Interventions, etc.):**\n   - The population is implied as "customers" (i.e., consumers engaging in online shopping), but it is not specified further (e.g., by geography, age group, or other demographics). The intervention or exposure is "online shopping" and its influencing factors, but these are not detailed in the title.\n   - The title does not specify the context (e.g., country or region), which in this case is Jordan, as revealed in the abstract and body. Including this would make the title more informative and precise.\n\n4. **Additional Information:**\n   - The title does not mention the method of analysis (e.g., meta-analysis), study designs included, or whether the review is an update or living review. However, these are not always required unless particularly relevant.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clearly identifies the report as a systematic review.\n- Communicates the main topic and general objective (factors influencing customer attitudes toward online shopping).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lacks specificity regarding the population (e.g., "in Jordan" or another relevant descriptor).\n- Does not specify the type of influencing factors (e.g., technological, cultural, etc.), though this may be acceptable for a broad review.\n- Does not mention the study design(s) included or the method of analysis, though this is not always necessary.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Specify the population or context in the title for greater clarity and relevance, e.g., "...in Jordan" if the review is limited to that country.\n- Optionally, clarify the type of influencing factors if the review is focused (e.g., "technological and cultural factors").\n- If a meta-analysis or specific study designs are included, consider mentioning this in the title.\n\n**Final Score: 4/5**\n- The title is adequately addressed: it is clear, identifies the work as a systematic review, and describes the main objective. However, it lacks some specificity regarding the population/context, which prevents a perfect score.', '**Evaluation of the Abstract According to PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts Checklist**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Identification as a Systematic Review:**\n   - The abstract states, "This study employed a qualitative systematic literature review methodology," and the title includes "systematic review."

While it outlines the rationale and objectives reasonably well, there remain significant areas for improvement, particularly in clarifying the relevance of the review against past literature, structurally defining the objectives, and employing a formal framework in the presentation. The overall effort demonstrates potential but requires refinements to enhance coherence and academic rigor. \n---', 'per_agent_result': ["**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Current State of Knowledge and Uncertainties:** The rationale provides a general overview of the growth of online shopping globally and in Jordan, referencing the impact of COVID-19 and the need to understand factors influencing customer attitudes. It notes that the online shopping sector in Jordan is underdeveloped and that there are uncertainties regarding consumer perceptions and adoption rates. \n\n2. **Importance of the Review:** The rationale states the necessity of understanding the factors influencing online shopping in Jordan, especially given the sector's immaturity and the potential for growth. It highlights the practical implications for online retailers and policymakers.\n\n3. **Existing Reviews and Justification for This Review:** The rationale references previous studies and reviews but does not explicitly state whether comprehensive systematic reviews on this specific topic already exist or if this review is an update or replication. It does, however, mention that there is a lack of government or up-to-date research, implying a gap.\n\n4. **Intervention Description:** The review is not about a specific intervention but about factors influencing attitudes. The rationale does describe relevant theoretical models (TAM, UTAUT, TPB) and how these might explain consumer behavior, which is appropriate for the topic.\n\n5. **Logic Model/Conceptual Framework:** The rationale references the use of conceptual frameworks (e.g., TAM, UTAUT, TPB) and includes a figure, but it does not provide a detailed or visual logic model specifically tailored to the complexity of the context or intervention.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clearly identifies the research gap in the context of Jordan.\n- Explains the importance of the review for practitioners and policymakers.\n- References relevant theoretical models to frame the review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Does not explicitly state whether previous systematic reviews exist or if this is an update/replication.\n- The rationale for why this review is needed in light of existing reviews is not fully developed.\n- The logic model/conceptual framework is referenced but not fully elaborated or visually presented in the rationale section.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Explicitly state whether previous systematic reviews exist and why this review is necessary (e.g., outdated, methodologically limited, or context-specific gaps).\n- Provide a more detailed or visual logic model to clarify the hypothesized relationships between factors and outcomes.\n- Clarify the unique contribution of this review compared to prior work.\n\n**Score:** 3/5\n\n**Justification:** The rationale is moderately addressed. It covers the context, importance, and theoretical framing with some depth, but lacks explicit discussion of prior reviews, a detailed logic model, and a clear statement of the review's unique necessity in light of existing literature.", '**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Explicit Statement of Objectives/Questions:** The objectives of the review are stated in the abstract and introduction: "The primary goal of this study is to investigate the major elements that impact customer attitudes regarding internet purchasing in Jordan." The review also aims to provide suggestions for online retailers and policymakers, and to identify areas for further research. However, the objectives are not presented in a dedicated, clearly labeled section, nor are they formulated as specific research questions.\n\n2. **Clarity and Scope:** The scope is reasonably clear: the review focuses on factors influencing customer attitudes toward online shopping in Jordan, using a systematic review of 100 peer-reviewed articles. The objectives are broad but understandable.\n\n3. **Alignment with Frameworks (e.g., PICO):** The objectives are not explicitly structured using a question formulation framework such as PICO, PICOS, or PICOT. While the review references theoretical models (TAM, UTAUT, TPB) in the literature review, the objectives themselves are not mapped to these frameworks or to a structured question format. There is no explicit mention of population, intervention, comparator, or outcome.\n\n4. **Link to Methods and Synthesis:** The objectives are generally aligned with the methods (systematic review, thematic analysis), but the lack of a structured question or framework makes it harder to assess whether all methodological choices are directly tied to the objectives.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The main objective is stated and the scope is clear.\n- The review identifies the population (Jordanian online shoppers) and the phenomenon of interest (factors influencing attitudes).\n- The objectives are consistent with the methods and findings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Objectives are not presented in a dedicated section or as specific, structured research questions.\n- No use of a formal question formulation framework (e.g., PICO, PICOS, PICOT).\n- The objectives could be more detailed, specifying the key variables or factors to be examined.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Present the objectives in a clearly labeled section, using concise and specific language.\n- Consider formulating the objectives as structured research questions, possibly using a relevant framework (e.g., "What are the key factors (O) influencing customer attitudes (O) toward online shopping (I) among consumers in Jordan (P)?").\n- Explicitly link the objectives to the theoretical frameworks discussed (TAM, UTAUT, TPB) and clarify how these guide the review.\n\n**Score:** 3/5\n\n**Justification:** The objectives are moderately addressed. They are present and generally clear, but lack the structure, specificity, and alignment with formal frameworks expected in a high-quality systematic review.

There is mention of using an Excel file to organize extracted data and a table to summarize recurring elements (e.g., trust, culture, security, perceived ease-of-use, perceived utility).\n- The process for deciding which studies were eligible for each synthesis is only partially described. Studies were grouped by recurring themes, but there is no detailed or structured approach to grouping, coding, or tabulating study characteristics beyond the thematic categories.\n- Methods for preparing data for synthesis are not described. There is no mention of handling missing data, transforming effect estimates, or performing any algebraic manipulations, which is expected given the qualitative nature of the synthesis. However, even for qualitative syntheses, more detail on data preparation and thematic coding would be expected.\n- The methods used to tabulate or visually display results are limited to a summary table of themes and frequencies. There is no use of graphical displays (e.g., forest plots, albatross plots), and the rationale for the chosen tabular structure is not discussed.\n- No quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) was attempted, and the rationale for this is implicit (heterogeneity, qualitative focus) but not explicitly stated. There is no discussion of statistical models, heterogeneity, or software used.\n- There is no description of methods to explore heterogeneity (e.g., subgroup analysis, meta-regression), nor any sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings.\n- The reporting lacks transparency and detail regarding the synthesis process, including how themes were developed, how disagreements were resolved, or how consistency was ensured.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Thematic synthesis is described at a high level, and a summary table of recurring elements is provided.\n- The review identifies and organizes key factors influencing customer attitudes toward online shopping in Jordan.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lack of detail and transparency in the synthesis methods: no structured approach to grouping, coding, or tabulating studies.\n- No description of data preparation methods, handling of missing data, or transformation of results.\n- Limited reporting of tabular/visual display methods; no graphical displays or rationale for chosen formats.\n- No explicit rationale for not conducting quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis.\n- No methods to explore heterogeneity or conduct sensitivity analyses.\n- No description of reviewer roles, independence, or disagreement resolution in the synthesis process.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Provide a detailed description of the thematic synthesis process, including how themes were developed, coded, and validated.\n- Clearly describe any methods used to prepare data for synthesis, even if only to state that no transformations or imputations were necessary.\n- Justify the choice of qualitative synthesis and explicitly state why quantitative synthesis was not possible or appropriate.\n- Include more detailed tabular or graphical displays of results, and explain the rationale for their selection.\n- Describe any methods used to explore heterogeneity or conduct sensitivity analyses, or explain why these were not performed.\n- Specify the roles of reviewers in the synthesis process and how disagreements were resolved.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe synthesis methods in this SLR are only partially addressed.

Limitations of the Evidence Included in the Review\n- The limitations section acknowledges the scarcity of research on online shopping in Jordan, the reliance on secondary data, the time frame of included studies, and the language barrier (exclusion of Arabic-only studies). It also notes the lack of government data and the predominance of secondary sources. However, the discussion could be more explicit about how these limitations impact the certainty or generalizability of the findings, and does not reference formal assessments of certainty/confidence in the evidence.\n- **Score: 3/5**\n\n#### 3. Limitations of the Review Processes Used\n- The review process limitations are mentioned, such as the exclusion of Arabic-language studies due to time constraints and the reliance on secondary data. The impact of these limitations on the findings is acknowledged, but the discussion lacks detail on other potential process limitations (e.g., single reviewer screening, database restrictions) and their possible effects on validity or completeness.\n- **Score: 2/5**\n\n#### 4. Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Research\n- The discussion provides practical recommendations for online retailers and policymakers, such as diversifying payment options, improving website usability, and leveraging social media for awareness. It also offers suggestions for future research, including the inclusion of Arabic-language studies and the collection of primary data. However, the discussion could be more explicit about trade-offs, stakeholder perspectives, and contextual factors affecting generalizability.\n- **Score: 4/5**\n\n---\n\n### Strengths\n- Clearly identifies and discusses the main findings and their theoretical implications.\n- Provides actionable recommendations for practitioners and policymakers.\n- Acknowledges several important limitations of the evidence and review process.\n- Suggests directions for future research.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- Limited direct comparison with other systematic reviews or primary studies.\n- Insufficient exploration of discordant findings or reasons for differences with other evidence.\n- Limited detail on how evidence and process limitations affect certainty or generalizability.\n- Some process limitations (e.g., screening, database selection) are not fully discussed.\n- Trade-offs and stakeholder perspectives are not deeply analyzed.\n\n### Suggestions\n- Include more explicit comparisons with other systematic reviews or primary studies, highlighting similarities and differences.\n- Discuss discordant findings in more depth and explore possible reasons for discrepancies.\n- Clearly link limitations of the evidence and review process to the certainty and applicability of the findings.\n- Address additional process limitations, such as screening methods and database restrictions.\n- Expand on the discussion of trade-offs, stakeholder perspectives, and contextual factors that may influence the generalizability of the results.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe Discussion section addresses most essential items with reasonable clarity and depth, but lacks thoroughness in comparing findings with other evidence, exploring discordant results, and detailing the impact of limitations. The implications for practice and future research are well articulated. Overall, the section is moderately comprehensive but could be improved with deeper analysis and more explicit connections to the broader literature and methodological rigor.']}, 6: {'overall_result': '## Overall Score: 0.75/5\n---\n\n*Registration and Protocol Evaluator*  \n*Score: 0/5*  \n*Summarized Feedback*: This review does not address any of the required elements for registration, protocol access, or amendment documentation.
