Thanks to advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which enables the early detection and diagnosis of DM through an automated process which is more advantageous than a manual diagnosis. Currently, many articles are published on automatic DM detection, diagnosis, and self-management via machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. This review delivers an analysis of the detection, diagnosis, and self-management techniques of DM from six different facets viz., datasets of DM, pre-processing methods, feature extraction methods, machine learning-based identification, classification, and diagnosis of DM, artificial intelligence-based intelligent DM assistant and performance measures. It also discusses the conclusions of the previous study and the importance of the results of the study. Also, three current research issues in the field of DM detection and diagnosis and self-management and personalization are listed. After a thorough screening procedure, 107 main publications from the Scopus and PubMed repositories are chosen for this study. This review provides a detailed overview of DM detection and self-management techniques which may prove valuable to the community of scientists employed in the area of automatic DM detection and self-management.

It mentions the existence of many published articles and the need for automated approaches. However, the discussion of uncertainties in the current knowledge is limited.\n2. **Importance of the Review:** The rationale states the importance of summarizing and analyzing the growing body of research on ML and AI for DM detection and self-management, highlighting the need for a comprehensive review that covers both ML and AI approaches, including self-management and personalization. This is reasonably well articulated.\n3. **Existing Reviews and Need for This Review:** The section briefly mentions that only a few review papers exist and that previous reviews have not covered both ML and AI approaches or certain essential facets (e.g., databases, pre-processing, feature extraction, intelligent assistants). However, it does not provide a detailed comparison with existing reviews, nor does it cite or critically appraise them to justify the necessity of this review.\n4. **Update or Replication:** There is no explicit statement about whether this review is an update or replication of a previous review, nor are previous reviews specifically cited in this context.\n5. **Intervention Description:** The rationale briefly describes how ML and AI interventions might work (e.g., automated detection, decision support, intelligent assistants), but this is not detailed or linked to a conceptual framework.\n6. **Logic Model/Conceptual Framework:** No logic model or conceptual framework is presented to illustrate the complexity of interventions or the hypothesized relationships between components and outcomes, despite the multifaceted nature of DM management.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clearly identifies the growing importance of ML and AI in DM detection and management.\n- States the intent to provide a comprehensive review covering both detection and self-management/personalization.\n- Outlines the main objectives and structure of the review.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Limited discussion of uncertainties or gaps in the current state of knowledge.\n- Insufficient critical appraisal of existing reviews and lack of explicit justification for why this review is needed beyond general statements.\n- No mention of whether this is an update or replication of previous reviews.\n- Lacks a logic model or conceptual framework to clarify the complexity of interventions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Expand the discussion of uncertainties and unresolved issues in the current literature.\n- Provide a more detailed comparison with existing systematic reviews, including citations and a critical appraisal of their limitations.\n- Clearly state if this review is an update or replication, and cite previous reviews if applicable.\n- Include a brief logic model or conceptual framework to illustrate how ML/AI interventions are hypothesized to impact DM detection and self-management, especially given the complexity of the topic.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe rationale section moderately addresses the requirements for a systematic review rationale. It establishes the importance of the topic and the intent to fill a gap but lacks depth in discussing uncertainties, existing reviews, and conceptual frameworks. Improvements in these areas would strengthen the justification for the review and its contribution to the field.', '**Evaluation of the Objectives Section**\n\n**Score:** 3/5\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n1. **Explicit Statement of Objectives/Questions:** The objectives are clearly listed in a dedicated section, enumerating seven specific aims related to datasets, pre-processing, feature extraction, ML/AI techniques, intelligent assistants, performance metrics, and future research directions in the context of diabetes mellitus (DM) detection and management.\n2. **Clarity and Scope:** The objectives are stated in a clear and organized manner, helping readers understand the intended scope of the review. They cover a broad range of aspects relevant to ML and AI in DM, from technical methods to practical applications.\n3. **Alignment with Frameworks (e.g., PICO):** The objectives are not explicitly formulated using a recognized question formulation framework such as PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) or its variants. While the population (DM patients) and interventions (ML/AI techniques) are implied, comparators and specific outcomes are not systematically defined.\n4. **Specificity and Measurability:** The objectives are somewhat general and descriptive (e.g., "review of datasets," "review of pre-processing techniques") rather than being framed as answerable questions or hypotheses. This limits the ability to directly assess whether the review methods and synthesis address the objectives in a focused way.\n5. **Relevance to Review Methods:** The objectives do provide a structure that aligns with the subsequent methods and synthesis, but the lack of a formal framework or explicit outcomes makes it harder to evaluate the adequacy of the review process against the objectives.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Objectives are explicitly stated and cover a comprehensive range of relevant topics.\n- The section is well-organized and easy to follow.\n- The objectives provide a clear roadmap for the review\'s structure.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Objectives are not formulated using a recognized framework (e.g., PICO), which is recommended for systematic reviews.\n- Lack of explicit definition of population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes.\n- Objectives are descriptive rather than question-based, reducing their specificity and measurability.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Reformulate the objectives using a structured framework such as PICO or a relevant variant, explicitly stating the population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes where applicable.\n- Frame objectives as answerable questions to enhance focus and measurability.\n- Specify the intended outcomes and comparisons to better align the objectives with systematic review best practices.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe objectives section is moderately addressed. While it is clear and comprehensive in scope, it lacks the structure and specificity expected in high-quality systematic reviews. Explicit use of a question formulation framework and clearer articulation of outcomes and comparisons would strengthen the section and improve the review\'s methodological rigor.']}, 3: {'overall_result': "## Overall Score: 1.1/5\n---\n\n*SLR Eligibility Criteria Evaluation Agent*  \n*Score: 1/5*  \n*Summarized Feedback*: The eligibility criteria are minimally addressed.

There is no description of a data extraction form or process.\n\n2. **Processes for Resolving Disagreements:**\n   - There is no information on how disagreements between data extractors (if any) were resolved. No mention of consensus meetings, arbitration, or referral to a third party.\n\n3. **Processes for Obtaining or Confirming Data from Study Investigators:**\n   - The paper does not report any attempts to contact study authors or investigators to obtain or confirm data. There is no description of outreach methods, data sought, or success rates.\n\n4. **Automation Tools Used for Data Collection:**\n   - There is no mention of automation tools (e.g., machine learning models, data extraction software) being used for data collection. No details on tool roles, training, or validation.\n\n5. **Translation Methods for Articles in Other Languages:**\n   - There is no information on whether any included articles were in languages other than English, nor on translation methods (human or software-based) if used.\n\n6. **Software Used to Extract Data from Figures:**\n   - There is no mention of any software used to extract data from figures or graphical data in the included studies.\n\n7. **Decision Rules for Selecting Data from Multiple Reports:**\n   - The paper does not describe any decision rules for selecting data from multiple reports of the same study, nor any process for resolving inconsistencies across reports.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides extensive tabular summaries of datasets, features, and methods used in the included studies, indicating that some data extraction did occur.\n- The review organizes extracted data into clear thematic categories (datasets, pre-processing, features, ML/AI methods, performance metrics).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No description of the data collection process, including number of reviewers, independence, or checking for accuracy.\n- No process for resolving disagreements is described.\n- No mention of contacting study authors for missing or unclear data.\n- No use or reporting of automation tools for data extraction.\n- No information on translation or extraction from non-English sources.\n- No mention of software for extracting data from figures.\n- No decision rules for handling multiple reports or inconsistent data.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Clearly specify the data extraction process, including the number of reviewers, whether they worked independently, and how accuracy was ensured.\n- Describe procedures for resolving disagreements between data extractors.\n- Report any efforts to obtain or confirm data from study authors, including methods and outcomes.\n- If automation tools or software were used for data extraction, provide details on their use, training, and validation.\n- Indicate whether translation was needed and, if so, how it was performed.\n- Specify any software used to extract data from figures or graphical sources.\n- Describe decision rules for selecting data from multiple reports and resolving inconsistencies.\n\n**Final Score: 1/5**\n\nThe data collection process is minimally addressed. While the review presents extracted data in tables and thematic summaries, there is no transparency or detail regarding how data were collected, who was involved, or how accuracy and consistency were ensured. The section does not meet the standards for systematic review data collection reporting.', '**Evaluation Points:**\n\n### Responsibility 1: Outcome Domains\n1. **Clarity and Definition of Outcome Domains:**\n   - The review identifies several outcome domains relevant to diabetes mellitus (DM) detection and management using ML/AI, such as detection, diagnosis, classification, self-management, and performance measures. However, these domains are not always explicitly defined with clear boundaries or operational definitions. For example, "detection," "diagnosis," and "classification" are used somewhat interchangeably, and the specific outcomes measured (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) are listed but not always linked to a conceptual framework.\n   - Time frames for measurement are not specified for outcome domains, except in a few cases (e.g., follow-up periods in datasets), and there is no systematic reporting of when outcomes were measured in the included studies.\n\n2. **Seeking All Results Compatible with Outcome Domains:**\n   - The review attempts to summarize all results compatible with each outcome domain by providing tables of datasets, features, ML/AI methods, and performance metrics. However, it is not clear if all possible results from each included study were sought or if only a subset was selected. There is no description of a process for prioritizing or selecting among multiple results per study.\n\n3. **Process for Selecting Results:**\n   - There is no explicit, justifiable process described for selecting which results to extract or report when multiple results are available for a given outcome domain. For example, when studies report multiple performance metrics or results at different time points, the review does not specify how it chose which to include.\n\n4. **Changes to Outcome Domains or Prioritization:**\n   - There is no mention of any changes made to the inclusion or definition of outcome domains during the review process, nor any rationale for such changes.\n\n5. **Critical/Important Outcomes:**\n   - The review does not specify which outcome domains were considered "critical" or "important" for the review’s conclusions, nor does it provide a rationale for any such prioritization.\n\n### Responsibility 2: Other Variables\n1. **Listing and Definition of Other Variables:**\n   - The review provides extensive tables listing datasets, features (shape, color, texture, text), pre-processing methods, and ML/AI techniques. Participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, type of diabetes) are sometimes mentioned in dataset descriptions, but not systematically defined or extracted across studies.\n   - Intervention details (e.g., type of ML/AI model, feature selection method) are described for each included study, but the level of detail varies and is not always standardized.\n   - Study settings and funding sources are not systematically reported or defined.\n\n2. **Assumptions about Missing or Unclear Information:**\n   - There is no explicit statement of assumptions made about missing or unclear information. For example, when participant age ranges or other characteristics are not reported in a study, the review does not describe how this was handled.\n\n3. **Use of Tools/Frameworks for Data Item Selection:**\n   - There is no mention of using a specific tool or framework to inform the selection of data items (e.g., for handling conflicts of interest or documenting intervention characteristics).\n\n4. **Comprehensiveness and Consistency:**\n   - The data collection is comprehensive in terms of the breadth of items covered (datasets, features, methods, performance metrics), but lacks consistency in definitions and depth across studies. Some variables are well-described in some studies but missing or vague in others, and the review does not address or standardize this.\n\n### Strengths\n- The review provides detailed tables summarizing datasets, features, ML/AI methods, and performance metrics used in included studies.\n- There is a broad attempt to capture a wide range of data items relevant to DM detection and management using ML/AI.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- Outcome domains are not clearly or consistently defined, and time frames are not specified.\n- There is no transparent or justifiable process for selecting among multiple results per study.\n- No rationale is provided for prioritizing certain outcomes or data items.\n- Other variables (participant characteristics, settings, funding) are inconsistently reported and not systematically defined.\n- No explicit handling of missing or unclear data is described.\n- No use of standardized tools or frameworks for data item selection.\n\n### Suggestions\n- Clearly define all outcome domains and specify time frames for measurement.\n- Establish and report a transparent process for selecting results when multiple are available per study (e.g., prioritize by completeness, relevance, or pre-specified hierarchy).\n- Specify which outcomes are considered critical or important and provide a rationale.\n- Systematically define and extract other variables (participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, funding) across all included studies.\n- State assumptions made about missing or unclear data and describe how such cases are handled.\n- Consider using or citing established frameworks or tools for data item selection and reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 2/5**\n\nThe data items section is partially addressed. While the review provides extensive tabular summaries and covers a broad range of data items, it lacks clarity, consistency, and transparency in definitions, selection processes, and handling of missing data. The section does not meet the standards for systematic review data item reporting, particularly regarding outcome domain definition, result selection, and comprehensive variable extraction.', "**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Risk of Bias Tool(s) and Version:**\n   - The review does not specify any tool, checklist, or framework (e.g., Cochrane RoB, ROBINS-I, QUADAS-2) used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. There is no mention of risk of bias assessment in the methods or results sections.\n\n2. **Reporting of Methodological Domains/Components/Items:**\n   - There is no reporting of any domains, components, or items typically associated with risk of bias tools. The review does not discuss study design, blinding, selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, or reporting bias for the included studies.\n\n3. **Overall Risk of Bias Judgment and Rules:**\n   - There is no indication that an overall risk of bias judgment was made for any included study, nor are any rules or criteria for such a judgment described.\n\n4. **Adaptations to Existing Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of adapting any existing risk of bias tool, nor of omitting or modifying items.\n\n5. **Development and Description of New Tool:**\n   - No new risk of bias tool is described or referenced.\n\n6. **Number of Reviewers, Independence, and Disagreement Resolution:**\n   - The review does not report how many reviewers, if any, assessed risk of bias, whether assessments were done independently, or how disagreements were resolved.\n\n7. **Processes to Obtain/Confirm Information from Study Investigators:**\n   - There is no mention of contacting study authors or investigators to obtain or confirm information relevant to risk of bias.\n\n8. **Use of Automation Tools for Risk of Bias Assessment:**\n   - There is no mention of any automation tools (e.g., machine learning models) being used for risk of bias assessment, nor any details on their use, training, or validation.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- None identified. The review does not address risk of bias assessment in any form.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No risk of bias tool or framework is specified or used.\n- No reporting of risk of bias domains, judgments, or processes.\n- No information on reviewer roles, independence, or disagreement resolution.\n- No mention of contacting study authors for clarification.\n- No use or reporting of automation tools for risk of bias.\n- No transparency or reproducibility in risk of bias assessment.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Specify and use an established risk of bias tool appropriate for the included study designs (e.g., Cochrane RoB for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, QUADAS-2 for diagnostic accuracy studies).\n- Clearly report the domains/components assessed and provide judgments for each included study.\n- Describe the process for making overall risk of bias judgments, including any rules or criteria used.\n- State the number of reviewers involved, whether they worked independently, and how disagreements were resolved.\n- Report any efforts to obtain or confirm information from study authors.\n- If automation tools are used, provide details on their use, training, and validation.\n- Include a summary table of risk of bias assessments for all included studies.\n\n**Final Score: 0/5**\n\nThe review does not address risk of bias assessment at all. There is no mention of tools, processes, or judgments related to risk of bias, and none of the essential elements are present. This is a critical omission for a systematic review and severely limits the interpretability and reliability of the review's findings.", '**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Effect Measures for Each Outcome:**\n   - The review discusses a variety of performance metrics (effect measures) used in the included studies, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), F-score, precision, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These are summarized in tables and discussed in the text. However, the review does not explicitly specify which effect measure is used for each outcome domain in a systematic or structured way. There is no mapping of effect measures to specific outcome types (e.g., binary, continuous), nor is there a rationale for the choice of effect measure per outcome.\n\n2. **Thresholds or Ranges for Interpreting Effect Size:**\n   - The review reports raw values of effect measures (e.g., accuracy percentages, AUC values) but does not state thresholds or ranges for interpreting the size of the effect (e.g., what constitutes a "good" or "poor" accuracy, or minimally important difference). There is no discussion of what is considered a trivial, small, moderate, or large effect, nor any rationale for such thresholds.\n\n3. **Re-expression of Synthesized Results to Different Effect Measures:**\n   - There is no evidence that synthesized results were re-expressed to different effect measures (e.g., converting accuracy to absolute risk reduction, or SMD to mean difference). The review simply reports the effect measures as presented in the original studies, without any transformation or harmonization across studies. Methods for any such re-expression are not documented because they were not performed.\n\n4. **Justification for Choice of Effect Measures:**\n   - The review does not provide a justification for the choice of effect measures. While it lists and summarizes the measures used in the included studies, it does not explain why certain measures (e.g., accuracy, AUC) are preferred or more appropriate for the outcomes of interest. There is no discussion of the appropriateness of different effect measures for different types of outcomes or study designs.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The review provides a comprehensive list of effect measures used in the included studies and summarizes them in tables.\n- There is a broad attempt to capture the range of performance metrics relevant to ML/AI-based DM detection and management.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Effect measures are not explicitly specified for each outcome or outcome type in a structured way.\n- No thresholds or interpretive ranges for effect sizes are provided or justified.\n- No re-expression or harmonization of effect measures across studies is performed or described.\n- No justification for the choice of effect measures is given.\n- The section lacks transparency, rationale, and methodological rigor in reporting and interpreting effect measures.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Explicitly specify which effect measure is used for each outcome or outcome type, and provide a rationale for each choice.\n- State and justify thresholds or ranges for interpreting the size of effect measures (e.g., what constitutes high or low accuracy/AUC).\n- If synthesizing results across studies, consider re-expressing effect measures to a common metric where appropriate, and document the methods used.\n- Discuss the appropriateness of different effect measures for different types of outcomes and provide justification for their use.\n- Include a summary table mapping outcomes to effect measures, thresholds, and rationales.\n\n**Final Score: 2/5**\n\nThe effect measures section is partially addressed. While the review lists and summarizes a range of effect measures, it lacks explicit specification, interpretive thresholds, re-expression methods, and justification for the choice of measures. The section does not meet the standards for clarity, transparency, and reproducibility expected in a systematic review\'s reporting of effect measures.', "**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Specification of Methods for Assessing Reporting Bias:**\n   - The review does not specify any methods, tools, or approaches for assessing the risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis (arising from reporting biases). There is no mention of funnel plots, statistical tests for small-study effects, outcome reporting bias assessment, or any other method to detect or evaluate reporting bias.\n\n2. **Use and Description of Existing Tools:**\n   - No existing tool (e.g., ROBIS, ROBINS-I, or any domain/component of a risk of bias tool related to reporting bias) is mentioned or described. There is no specification of methodological components, domains, or items related to reporting bias.\n\n3. **Adaptations to Existing Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of any adaptations to existing tools for assessing reporting bias, nor any description of omitted or modified items.\n\n4. **Development and Description of New Tools:**\n   - No new tool for assessing reporting bias is described or referenced. There is no content on tool development, content, or public accessibility.\n\n5. **Number of Reviewers and Disagreement Resolution:**\n   - The review does not report how many reviewers, if any, were involved in assessing reporting bias, nor whether assessments were done independently or how disagreements were resolved.\n\n6. **Processes to Obtain or Confirm Information from Study Investigators:**\n   - There is no mention of contacting study authors or investigators to obtain or confirm information relevant to reporting bias (e.g., unpublished outcomes, selective reporting).\n\n7. **Use of Automation Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of any automation tools (e.g., machine learning models) being used for reporting bias assessment, nor any details on their use, training, or validation.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- None identified.

There is no mention of certainty/confidence assessment in the methods or results.\n\n2. **Factors and Criteria Considered:**\n   - No factors (e.g., precision, consistency, directness, publication bias) or criteria for assessing certainty are reported. There is no discussion of how the certainty of evidence was evaluated or what aspects were considered.\n\n3. **Decision Rules and Interpretation of Certainty Levels:**\n   - There are no decision rules described for arriving at an overall judgment of certainty (e.g., high, moderate, low, very low), nor are any definitions or intended interpretations of certainty levels provided.\n\n4. **Review-Specific Considerations (Thresholds, Ranges, Rationale):**\n   - No review-specific considerations, thresholds for imprecision, or ranges of effect magnitudes are reported. There is no rationale for any such thresholds or ranges because none are described.\n\n5. **Adaptations to Existing Tools:**\n   - No adaptations to any existing tool or system are described, as no tool is used or referenced.\n\n6. **Number of Reviewers, Independence, Disagreement Resolution:**\n   - The number of reviewers involved in any certainty assessment is not stated, nor is there any mention of independent assessment or processes for resolving disagreements.\n\n7. **Processes to Obtain/Confirm Information from Investigators:**\n   - There is no report of any processes to obtain or confirm relevant information from study investigators for the purpose of certainty assessment.\n\n8. **Use of Automation Tools:**\n   - There is no mention of any automation tool being used to support certainty assessment, nor any description of tool use, training, or validation.\n\n9. **Methods for Reporting Certainty Assessments:**\n   - No methods for reporting the results of certainty assessments (e.g., Summary of Findings tables) are described or used.\n\n10. **Standard Phrases Incorporating Certainty:**\n    - No standard phrases incorporating the certainty of evidence are reported, nor is there any intended interpretation or reference to source guidance.\n\n11. **Adherence to Published System:**\n    - There is no indication that a published system for certainty assessment is adhered to, nor are any factors or decision rules described or referenced.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- None identified.

While the search process and final inclusion numbers are described, the lack of a flow diagram, detailed exclusion reporting, and transparency about excluded studies significantly limits clarity and reproducibility. Substantial improvements are needed to meet best-practice standards.', '**Score: 3 / 5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Citation of Included Studies:**\n   - The SLR provides citations for included studies throughout the text and especially in the tables (e.g., Table 1 for datasets, Table 2 for pre-processing techniques, Table 3 for features, Table 4 for ML classifiers, Table 5 for intelligent DM assistants). This allows for traceability and accessibility.\n\n2. **Presentation of Key Study Characteristics:**\n   - The SLR presents key characteristics of included studies in several tables. For example, Table 1 details datasets used (name, description, URL, references), and other tables summarize features, pre-processing methods, and ML techniques. However, these tables focus more on technical and methodological aspects (e.g., dataset source, features, algorithms) rather than comprehensive study-level characteristics.\n   - There is no single, consolidated table that presents for each included study the full range of recommended characteristics (e.g., study design, participant characteristics, outcome ascertainment methods, funding sources, and competing interests). Some information (e.g., country, sample size, participant demographics) is scattered or missing for many studies.\n   - Funding sources and competing interests of the included studies are not reported.\n\n3. **Intervention Details (if applicable):**\n   - The review does not provide a dedicated table summarizing intervention details for each study, as would be expected for reviews of intervention effects (e.g., using TIDieR or similar frameworks). While some intervention-related information is present in the narrative and tables, it is not systematically or comprehensively reported.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Included studies are cited and traceable.\n- Multiple tables present technical and methodological characteristics (datasets, features, algorithms).\n- Some participant and study-level details are provided for datasets.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No comprehensive, consolidated table of study characteristics (design, population, outcomes, funding, competing interests) for all included studies.\n- Key elements such as outcome ascertainment methods, funding sources, and competing interests are not reported.\n- No intervention summary table (where applicable).\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Add a comprehensive table summarizing, for each included study: citation, study design, country, sample size, participant characteristics, outcome ascertainment methods, funding sources, and competing interests.\n- If the review examines intervention effects, include a table summarizing intervention details per TIDieR or similar frameworks.\n- Ensure all key characteristics are presented in a way that facilitates comparison and transparency.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR moderately addresses the reporting of included study characteristics. While citations and some technical details are well-presented, the lack of a comprehensive characteristics table and omission of key elements (e.g., funding, outcome methods) limit transparency and reproducibility. Improvements are needed to fully meet best-practice standards.', '**Score: 0 / 5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Presentation of Risk of Bias Assessments (Tables/Figures):**\n   - The SLR does not present any table, figure, or summary that indicates, for each included study, the risk of bias in each domain/component/item assessed. There is no mention of a risk of bias tool (e.g., RoB 2.0, QUADAS-2, or any other) being used, nor is there any structured reporting of risk of bias at the study or outcome level.\n\n2. **Justification for Risk of Bias Judgments:**\n   - There are no justifications provided for risk of bias judgments, as no such judgments are reported. There are no quotations, descriptions, or references to study methods that would allow readers to understand the basis for any risk of bias assessment.\n\n3. **Display of Risk of Bias Judgments Alongside Results:**\n   - The SLR does not display risk of bias judgments alongside study results in any forest plot or similar visual representation. In fact, there are no forest plots or meta-analyses presented, and no linkage of risk of bias to study findings.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides extensive tables summarizing datasets, features, and machine learning methods, which are useful for technical appraisal.\n- The review includes a large number of studies and provides detailed technical summaries.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No risk of bias assessment is reported for any included study.\n- No structured or narrative discussion of potential sources of bias in the included studies.\n- No justifications or supporting evidence for risk of bias judgments.\n- No visual or tabular summary of risk of bias at the study or outcome level.\n- No consideration of how risk of bias might affect the interpretation of results or conclusions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Conduct and report a structured risk of bias assessment for each included study using an appropriate tool (e.g., RoB 2.0 for RCTs, QUADAS-2 for diagnostic accuracy studies, or a relevant tool for ML/AI studies).\n- Present a table summarizing, for each study, the risk of bias in each domain and overall, with justifications (e.g., direct quotes or paraphrased methods from the original studies).\n- If risk of bias is assessed at the outcome/result level, display these judgments alongside study results (e.g., in a forest plot or summary table).\n- Discuss the implications of risk of bias for the review’s findings and conclusions.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR does not address the risk of bias assessment for included studies. There is no evidence of any risk of bias tool being used, no tabular or narrative summary of risk of bias, and no discussion of how bias might affect the review’s findings.

For many studies, details such as sample size, dataset description, and sometimes the number of events or participants are reported. However, for most outcomes, summary statistics (e.g., number of participants with/without events, means, standard deviations) are not consistently or comprehensively reported for each group within each study.\n\n2. **Effect Estimates and Precision:**\n   - The SLR reports performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for many included studies, often in Table 4. However, effect estimates (such as risk ratios, odds ratios, or mean differences) and their precision (e.g., standard errors, 95% confidence intervals) are not systematically reported for each study. Where performance metrics are given, confidence intervals or measures of uncertainty are rarely provided.\n\n3. **Visual or Tabular Presentation:**\n   - Study-level data are presented in tabular format throughout the SLR (notably in Tables 1–6). However, there are no forest plots or similar visual summaries of individual study results. The tables are structured and facilitate comparison, but the lack of visual representation limits interpretability for some readers.\n\n4. **Source of Data:**\n   - The SLR generally reports the source of data for each study, especially in Table 1 (datasets), including URLs and references. When data are self-created, this is also noted. However, for studies where data are obtained from multiple sources or through author correspondence, this is not always specified.\n\n5. **Computed or Estimated Results:**\n   - There is no explicit indication in the tables or text when results have been computed or estimated by the review authors (rather than directly reported in the original studies). This reduces transparency regarding the provenance of the reported results.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Comprehensive tabular presentation of technical and methodological details for each study.\n- Performance metrics for many studies are reported, facilitating some level of comparison.\n- Data sources are generally well-documented, especially for datasets.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Summary statistics for all outcomes and groups are not consistently reported for each study.\n- Effect estimates and their precision (e.g., confidence intervals) are rarely provided.\n- No forest plots or equivalent visual summaries of individual study results.\n- Lack of explicit statements regarding computed/estimated results versus directly reported results.\n- Some tables focus on technical aspects rather than outcome data, limiting reusability for meta-analysis.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- For each outcome, report summary statistics (e.g., number of events, means, SDs, sample sizes) for each group in each study, where appropriate.\n- Provide effect estimates and their precision (e.g., 95% CIs) for each study, even if no meta-analysis is performed.\n- Include forest plots or similar visual summaries to enhance interpretability and transparency.\n- Clearly indicate when results are computed or estimated by the review authors, and specify the methods used.\n- Ensure all data sources are explicitly stated, especially when data are synthesized from multiple sources.\n\n**Use of Structured Tables/Plots:**\n- The SLR makes extensive use of structured tables to present study-level data, which supports clarity and comparison. However, the absence of forest plots or similar visualizations is a notable gap.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR moderately addresses the comprehensive reporting of individual study results. While structured tables provide useful technical and performance information, the lack of consistent summary statistics, effect estimates with precision, and visual presentation limits transparency, interpretability, and reusability. Substantial improvements are needed to fully meet best-practice standards for reporting individual study results in systematic reviews.', "**Score: 2 / 5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n**Responsibility 1: Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias (for each synthesis)**\n- The SLR provides some summary of study characteristics, mainly through tables (e.g., Table 1 for datasets, Table 4 for ML classifiers), and lists studies contributing to each synthesis. However, these are focused on technical/methodological aspects (datasets, features, algorithms) rather than essential characteristics for interpreting results (e.g., study design, population, outcome ascertainment). There is no explicit summary of risk of bias for studies contributing to each synthesis, nor is there any structured or narrative discussion of risk of bias issues. The studies included in each synthesis are generally listed, but the essential characteristics relevant to applicability and bias are not systematically documented. \n\n**Responsibility 2: Statistical Synthesis Results**\n- The SLR does not conduct any meta-analysis or formal statistical synthesis. Where performance metrics are reported (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC), these are presented for individual studies, not as pooled or summary estimates. There is no reporting of summary estimates with precision (e.g., 95% CI), no measures of statistical heterogeneity (e.g., I2), and no clear statement of direction of effect for group comparisons. Units of measurement and scale limits are inconsistently reported, and standardized mean differences or instrument details are not relevant to the review's focus. Overall, statistical synthesis is minimally addressed.\n\n**Responsibility 3: Heterogeneity Investigations**\n- There is no formal investigation of heterogeneity among study results. The SLR does not present subgroup analyses, meta-regression, or informal grouping to explore sources of heterogeneity. There is no identification of studies contributing to subgroups, no reporting of interaction P values, and no relevant plots. The review does not discuss or present any investigation of effect modification or heterogeneity.\n\n**Responsibility 4: Sensitivity Analyses Results**\n- The SLR does not report any sensitivity analyses. There are no tables or forest plots presenting sensitivity analysis results, no commentary on the robustness of main analyses, and no description of alternative assumptions or analytic approaches.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides extensive tables listing included studies, datasets, features, and performance metrics, which supports technical comparison.\n- Studies contributing to each synthesis are generally listed or cited.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No risk of bias assessment or summary is provided for studies contributing to syntheses.\n- No statistical synthesis (meta-analysis) is performed; no summary estimates, precision, or heterogeneity measures are reported.\n- No investigation of heterogeneity or effect modification.\n- No sensitivity analyses are conducted or reported.\n- Essential characteristics for interpreting synthesized results (e.g., applicability, bias) are not systematically documented.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Provide a brief summary of essential study characteristics and risk of bias for studies contributing to each synthesis, including a table or narrative summary.\n- If statistical synthesis is not feasible, clearly state this and provide a rationale; otherwise, conduct and report meta-analyses with summary estimates, precision, and heterogeneity measures.\n- Investigate and report possible causes of heterogeneity, including subgroup analyses or meta-regression where appropriate.\n- Conduct and report sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of main findings.\n- Use forest plots or structured tables to visually present synthesis results, subgroup findings, and sensitivity analyses.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR minimally addresses the essential items required for synthesis of study results. While included studies and some technical details are listed, there is no risk of bias summary, no statistical synthesis, no investigation of heterogeneity, and no sensitivity analyses. The absence of these elements limits the interpretability, transparency, and reliability of the synthesized results. Substantial improvements are needed to meet best-practice standards for synthesis in systematic reviews.", '**Score: 0 / 5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Assessment of Risk of Bias Due to Missing Results (Reporting Biases):**\n   - The SLR does not present any explicit assessment of the risk of bias due to missing results in any synthesis. There is no discussion of selective outcome reporting, publication bias, or other reporting biases. No tool (e.g., ROB-ME, or similar) is used or referenced for this purpose.\n\n2. **Funnel Plots and Small-Study Effects:**\n   - There is no mention or presentation of funnel plots to assess small-study effects or reporting biases. No effect estimates or measures of precision are plotted or discussed. There is no reference to contour-enhanced funnel plots or specification of statistical significance milestones (e.g., P=0.01, 0.05, 0.1).\n\n3. **Tests for Funnel Plot Asymmetry:**\n   - No statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., Egger’s test) are reported. No P values or relevant statistics are provided.\n\n4. **Sensitivity Analyses for Missing Results:**\n   - The SLR does not conduct or report any sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of missing results on the syntheses. There is no comparison of sensitivity analysis results with primary analyses, nor any discussion of the limitations of such methods.\n\n5. **Additional Elements (Selective Non-Reporting, Matrix/Table of Availability):**\n   - There is no matrix or table showing the availability of study results by synthesis, nor any display of missing studies beneath forest plots or in summary tables. There is no attempt to identify or discuss studies with selectively non-reported outcomes.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides extensive tables summarizing included studies, datasets, and performance metrics, which is useful for technical comparison.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No assessment or discussion of risk of bias due to missing results or reporting biases.\n- No funnel plots, contour-enhanced funnel plots, or tests for small-study effects/asymmetry.\n- No sensitivity analyses for missing results.\n- No matrix or table of selectively non-reported outcomes or missing studies.\n- No transparency regarding the potential impact of reporting biases on the syntheses.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Explicitly assess and report the risk of bias due to missing results for each synthesis, using a structured tool or framework (e.g., ROB-ME).\n- Generate and present funnel plots (and contour-enhanced versions if appropriate) for syntheses with sufficient studies, specifying effect estimates and measures of precision.\n- Conduct and report statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry, including exact P values and relevant statistics.\n- Perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing results, and compare these with primary analyses.\n- Present a matrix or table showing the availability of study results for each synthesis, and identify any selectively non-reported outcomes.\n- Discuss the limitations of the review regarding potential reporting biases and their impact on the trustworthiness of the results.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR does not address the risk of bias due to missing results or reporting biases in any synthesis. There is no use of funnel plots, no sensitivity analyses, and no structured assessment or discussion of selective reporting. This is a critical omission that undermines the transparency and reliability of the review’s findings. Substantial improvements are required to meet best-practice standards for assessing and reporting the risk of bias due to missing results in systematic reviews.\n\n**Confirmation:**\nThe risk of bias due to missing results is **not** assessed transparently or thoroughly for any synthesis in this SLR.', '**Score: 1 / 5**\n\n**Evaluation Points:**\n\n1. **Reporting of Certainty of Evidence for Each Outcome:**\n   - The SLR does not explicitly report the certainty of evidence for any outcome. There is no use of GRADE or any other formal system to rate the certainty (e.g., high, moderate, low, very low) for the main outcomes of interest (e.g., diagnostic accuracy, performance of ML/AI models, self-management interventions).\n   - No summary of findings table or equivalent is provided that presents certainty ratings alongside effect estimates or performance metrics.\n\n2. **Justification for Certainty Ratings:**\n   - There are no explanations or footnotes justifying any certainty ratings, as no such ratings are given. There is no discussion of downgrading or upgrading evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias.\n   - The review does not discuss the overall confidence in the body of evidence for any outcome, nor does it provide transparent reasoning for the reliability of the findings.\n\n3. **Communication of Certainty in Evidence:**\n   - Certainty is not communicated in the abstract, results, discussion, or conclusions. Standard phrases such as "probably reduces" or "may have little or no effect" are not used.\n   - Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity) are reported for individual studies, but without any synthesis or statement about the certainty of the evidence base as a whole.\n\n4. **Use of Evidence Summary Tables:**\n   - No GRADE Summary of Findings table or similar evidence summary table is included. Tables focus on technical details (datasets, features, algorithms) and performance metrics, not on certainty of evidence.\n\n5. **Interpretation and Impact on Conclusions:**\n   - The conclusions do not reflect any assessment of certainty or confidence in the evidence. There is no guidance for readers on how much trust to place in the findings, nor any discussion of how limitations in the evidence base affect the review’s implications.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The SLR provides extensive technical summaries and performance metrics for included studies, which could serve as a foundation for certainty assessment if further developed.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- No explicit or implicit assessment of certainty of evidence for any outcome.\n- No use of GRADE or similar frameworks.\n- No justifications or explanations for certainty ratings.\n- No summary of findings or evidence tables presenting certainty.\n- No communication of certainty in the text, tables, or conclusions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- For each important outcome, assess and report the certainty of evidence using a recognized system such as GRADE. Clearly state the certainty level (high, moderate, low, very low) for each outcome.\n- Provide transparent justifications for any downgrading or upgrading of certainty, including considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n- Include a summary of findings table that presents effect estimates/performance metrics alongside certainty ratings and explanations.\n- Use standard phrases to communicate certainty in the results and conclusions (e.g., "X probably improves Y" or "X may have little or no effect on Y").\n- Discuss how the certainty of evidence affects the interpretation and implications of the review’s findings.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe SLR does not address the certainty of evidence for any outcome. There is no use of GRADE or any other system, no summary of findings table, and no justifications or communication of certainty. This is a critical omission that limits the transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness of the review’s conclusions. Substantial improvements are needed to meet best-practice standards for assessing and reporting certainty of evidence in systematic reviews.']}, 5: {'overall_result': '## Overall Score: 3/5\n---\n\n*Discussion Evaluator*  \n*Score: 3/5*  \n*Summarized Feedback*: The Discussion section addresses most essential items with some depth and clarity, but lacks thoroughness in comparison with other evidence, discussion of discordant results, and explicit consideration of process limitations and stakeholder perspectives.  \n\n---\n#### Overall Feedback: The paper offers a solid overview of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications for Diabetes Mellitus detection and self-management.
