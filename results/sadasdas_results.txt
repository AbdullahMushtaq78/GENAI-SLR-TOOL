We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of these anticoagulants. Inclusion criteria were studies involving adult patients diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome, while exclusion criteria included studies with non-comparable interventions or those not reporting relevant outcomes. We searched databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus up to March 2023. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results were synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis. A total of 15 studies with 2,500 participants were included. Rivaroxaban showed a significant reduction in thromboembolic events compared to warfarin (risk ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85). Limitations include potential publication bias and variability in study designs. Our findings suggest that rivaroxaban may be a more effective option for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.

This lack of detail raises concerns about the reliability of the assessment.  \n6. **Information Confirmation:** There is no mention of processes to obtain or confirm relevant information from study investigators regarding missing results, which could enhance the reliability of the bias assessment.  \n7. **Automation Tool Usage:** The review does not indicate whether any automation tools were used to assist in assessing the risk of bias due to missing results, nor does it provide details on how such tools would have been applied if they were used.  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The use of funnel plots and comparison of trial protocols with published outcomes indicates an effort to assess reporting biases.  \n- The acknowledgment of potential publication bias shows awareness of the issue in systematic reviews.  \n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Lack of detail on the generation and interpretation of funnel plots limits transparency.  \n- Insufficient information on the number of protocols reviewed and criteria for discrepancies reduces the robustness of the outcome reporting bias assessment.  \n- Absence of information on reviewer involvement and disagreement resolution diminishes the reliability of the assessment.  \n- No mention of processes to confirm information from study investigators or the use of automation tools reduces the potential for thoroughness in the assessment.  \n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- Provide a detailed description of how funnel plots were generated and interpreted to enhance transparency.  \n- Specify the number of trial protocols reviewed and the criteria used to assess discrepancies between reported and specified outcomes.  \n- Include information on the number of reviewers involved in the assessment and how disagreements were resolved.  \n- Consider implementing processes to confirm relevant information from study investigators to strengthen the reliability of the assessments.  \n- If applicable, describe any automation tools used in the assessment of reporting biases and their role in the process.', '**Evaluation of Certainty Assessment Methods**\n\n**Final Score: 3**  \n\n**Evaluation Points:**  \n1. **Tool Specification:** The review mentions the use of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system for assessing the certainty of evidence, but it does not specify the version used or provide a citation for the tool.  \n2. **Factors Considered:** The review outlines the factors considered in the certainty assessment, including study limitations, consistency of findings, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. However, the specific criteria used to assess each factor are not detailed, which limits transparency.  \n3. **Decision Rules:** The review states that the overall judgment of certainty is categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low, but the decision rules used to arrive at these judgments are not clearly articulated. This lack of clarity may hinder understanding of how the overall judgment was reached.  \n4. **Review-Specific Considerations:** There is no mention of any review-specific considerations for assessing certainty, such as thresholds for imprecision or ranges of effect magnitudes, which could enhance the robustness of the assessment.  \n5. **Adaptations to Existing Tools:** There is no mention of any adaptations made to the GRADE system, nor is there any description of how the tool was applied in the context of the review.  \n6. **Reviewer Involvement:** The review states that two reviewers independently assessed the certainty of evidence, but it does not specify how disagreements were resolved or if a third reviewer was involved in the process.  \n7. **Information Confirmation:** There is no mention of any processes to obtain or confirm relevant information from study investigators, which could enhance the reliability of the certainty assessments.  \n8. **Automation Tool Usage:** The review does not indicate whether any automation tools were used in the certainty assessment, nor does it provide details on how such tools would have been applied if they were used.  \n9. **Reporting Methods:** The review mentions using Summary of Findings tables to report the results of certainty assessments, but it lacks detail on how these tables were constructed and what information they included.  \n10. **Standard Phrases:** There is no mention of standard phrases incorporating the certainty of evidence, which could aid in communicating the findings effectively.  \n11. **Adherence to Published Systems:** While the review adheres to the GRADE system, it does not briefly describe the factors considered and decision rules for reaching an overall judgment, nor does it reference the source guidance for full details.  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The use of the GRADE system for assessing certainty is a positive aspect, indicating an effort to adhere to established standards.  \n- The involvement of two independent reviewers adds a layer of reliability to the assessment process.  \n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Lack of detail regarding the specific criteria used to assess factors limits transparency and understanding of the assessment process.  \n- Absence of clear rules for deriving the overall certainty judgment raises concerns about the consistency of the assessments.  \n- No information on how disagreements were resolved or confirmation processes with study investigators diminishes the robustness of the certainty evaluation.  \n- The lack of mention of automation tools or their application reduces the potential for efficiency in the assessment process.  \n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- Provide a detailed description of the specific criteria used to assess each factor in the GRADE system to enhance transparency.  \n- Clearly articulate the rules used to derive the overall certainty judgment to improve understanding and replicability.  \n- Include information on how disagreements between reviewers were resolved and whether a third reviewer was involved.  \n- Consider implementing processes to confirm relevant information from study investigators to strengthen the reliability of the assessments.  \n- If applicable, describe any automation tools used in the certainty assessment and their role in the process.', '**Evaluation of Synthesis Methods**\n\n**Final Score: 3**  \n\n**Evaluation Points:**  \n1. **Synthesis Methods Description:** The synthesis methods are mentioned, but the details provided are somewhat vague. While the review states that a meta-analysis was conducted, it does not specify the model used (fixed-effect or random-effects) or provide a rationale for the choice. This lack of clarity limits understanding of the synthesis approach.  \n2. **Heterogeneity Assessment:** The review mentions assessing heterogeneity but does not detail the methods used to quantify it (e.g., I² statistics, τ²). The absence of specific statistical tests or visual inspections for heterogeneity reduces transparency in the synthesis process.  \n3. **Statistical Tools and Software:** The review does not specify the software or packages used for the meta-analysis, which is essential for replicability. Without this information, it is unclear how the analyses were conducted.  \n4. **Handling of Multiple Effect Estimates:** If multiple effect estimates from a single study were included, the methods for handling dependency between these estimates are not described. This omission could lead to potential biases in the synthesis results.  \n5. **Sensitivity Analyses:** The review does not mention any sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the robustness of the synthesized results. This is a significant gap, as sensitivity analyses are crucial for understanding the reliability of the findings.  \n6. **Subgroup Analyses:** There is no mention of any subgroup analyses performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the comprehensiveness of the synthesis methods.  \n7. **Results Presentation:** The results of the synthesis are presented, but the clarity of the presentation could be improved. For example, the use of forest plots or summary tables is not mentioned, which are standard practices for visualizing synthesis results.  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The mention of conducting a meta-analysis indicates an effort to quantitatively synthesize the data.  \n- Acknowledgment of heterogeneity assessment shows awareness of the complexities involved in synthesizing diverse studies.  \n\n**Weaknesses:**  \n- Lack of detail regarding the synthesis methods, including model choice and statistical tools, limits transparency and replicability.  \n- Absence of sensitivity and subgroup analyses raises concerns about the robustness of the findings.  \n- Insufficient clarity in the presentation of results diminishes the overall understanding of the synthesis outcomes.  \n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- Provide a clear description of the synthesis methods used, including the specific model for meta-analysis and the rationale for its selection.  \n- Detail the methods used to assess heterogeneity, including any statistical tests or visual inspections performed.  \n- Specify the software and packages used for the analyses to enhance replicability.  \n- Include information on how multiple effect estimates were handled and whether sensitivity analyses were conducted.  \n- Consider performing subgroup analyses to explore potential sources of heterogeneity and document these methods clearly.  \n- Improve the presentation of results by including standard visual aids such as forest plots or summary tables to enhance clarity.']}, 4: {'overall_result': '## Overall Score: 3/5\n---\n\nStudy Selection Evaluator  \nScore: 3/5\\Summarized Feedback: The study selection process was clearly outlined, detailing the number of records identified, screened, and included.

Assessments of Risk of Bias\nIn our systematic review, we evaluated the risk of bias due to missing results, particularly focusing on reporting biases. We found that several studies did not report all pre-specified outcomes, which raises concerns about selective reporting. Specifically, we identified that out of the 20 included studies, 8 did not report results for key outcomes that were pre-specified in their protocols. This selective non-reporting could potentially skew the overall findings of the review.\n\n#### 2. Use of Tools for Risk of Bias Assessment\nWe utilized the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool to assess the risk of bias for each included study. The tool prompted us to evaluate the following questions:\n- Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?\n- Was the allocation adequately concealed?\n- Were participants and personnel blinded to the intervention?\n- Were outcome data adequately addressed?\n- Were the reported results consistent with the pre-specified outcomes?\n\n**Judgments and Supporting Evidence:**  \n- **Allocation Sequence:** 15 studies were judged as low risk, while 5 had some concerns.  \n- **Allocation Concealment:** 12 studies were low risk, 8 had some concerns.  \n- **Blinding:** 10 studies were low risk, 10 had some concerns.  \n- **Outcome Data:** 18 studies were low risk, 2 had high risk due to missing data.  \n- **Reporting Consistency:** 8 studies had high risk due to selective reporting of outcomes.  \n\nOverall, we assessed that 10 out of 20 studies had a high risk of bias due to missing results and selective reporting.\n\n#### 3. Funnel Plot Analysis\nA funnel plot was generated to evaluate small-study effects and potential reporting biases. The plot displayed the effect estimates (MD) on the horizontal axis and the standard error (SE) on the vertical axis. The plot indicated asymmetry, suggesting the presence of reporting bias. \n\n![Funnel Plot](insert_funnel_plot_link_here)  \n*Effect Estimate: Mean Difference (MD) = -0.45, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.20*\n\n#### 4. Contour-Enhanced Funnel Plot\nA contour-enhanced funnel plot was also created to visualize statistical significance milestones. The contours indicated areas of significance at P=0.01, P=0.05, and P=0.1. The asymmetry observed in the funnel plot was more pronounced in the areas of lower significance, indicating potential publication bias.\n\n#### 5. Test for Funnel Plot Asymmetry\nWe conducted a test for funnel plot asymmetry using Egger's test, which yielded a P value of 0.03, indicating significant asymmetry and suggesting the presence of reporting bias. The standardized normal deviate was calculated to be 2.5, further supporting the evidence of bias.\n\n#### 6. Sensitivity Analyses\nSensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of missing results on the overall synthesis. We compared the primary analysis with a secondary analysis that included only studies with low risk of bias. The results showed a significant difference:\n- **Primary Analysis:** MD = -0.45 (95% CI -0.70 to -0.20)  \n- **Sensitivity Analysis (Low Risk Studies Only):** MD = -0.30 (95% CI -0.50 to -0.10)  \n\nThis indicates that the overall effect estimate was influenced by the inclusion of studies with high risk of bias due to missing results. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe risk of bias due to missing results in our systematic review was assessed transparently and thoroughly. The presence of selective reporting and the results of the funnel plot analysis highlight the need for caution in interpreting the findings. \n\n### Final Score: 4 (Adequately Addressed)\n\n#### Evaluation Points:\n- **Strengths:** Comprehensive assessment of risk of bias, clear presentation of funnel plot and sensitivity analysis results.\n- **Weaknesses:** Some studies had high risk of bias due to missing results, which could affect the overall conclusions.\n- **Suggestions:** Future reviews should ensure that all pre-specified outcomes are reported to minimize the risk of bias due to missing results.", '### Certainty of Evidence Assessment\n\n#### Outcome 1: Effect of Intervention on Primary Outcome\n- **Certainty Level**: Moderate\n- **Justification**: The evidence was downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias and imprecision. Specifically, 10 out of 20 studies had a high risk of bias due to missing results and selective reporting, which raises concerns about the reliability of the findings. Additionally, the confidence intervals for the effect estimates were wide, indicating imprecision in the results.\n\n#### Outcome 2: Secondary Outcomes (e.g., Quality of Life)\n- **Certainty Level**: Low\n- **Justification**: The evidence was downgraded due to serious concerns about risk of bias and inconsistency. Many studies did not report all pre-specified outcomes, leading to selective reporting. Furthermore, the results across studies were inconsistent, with some studies showing significant effects while others did not, which contributes to uncertainty in the overall effect.\n\n#### Outcome 3: Adverse Events\n- **Certainty Level**: Very Low\n- **Justification**: The evidence was downgraded due to very serious concerns about risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. The funnel plot analysis indicated significant asymmetry, suggesting potential publication bias. Additionally, the small number of studies reporting adverse events and the lack of consistent reporting across studies further contribute to the low certainty of evidence.\n\n### Summary of Certainty Levels\n| Outcome                          | Certainty Level | Justification Summary                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Effect of Intervention on Primary Outcome | Moderate         | Downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision due to high-risk studies and wide confidence intervals.      |\n| Secondary Outcomes (Quality of Life)       | Low              | Downgraded for serious risk of bias and inconsistency due to selective reporting and variable results.   |\n| Adverse Events                     | Very Low         | Downgraded for very serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency due to publication bias and limited reporting. |\n\n### Conclusion\nThe certainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed in this systematic review varies, with moderate certainty for the primary outcome, low certainty for secondary outcomes, and very low certainty for adverse events. These ratings reflect the need for cautious interpretation of the findings, particularly in light of the identified biases and inconsistencies across studies.']}, 5: {'overall_result': '## Overall Score: 4/5\n---\n\nDiscussion Evaluator  \nScore: 4/5  \nSummarized Feedback: The discussion section effectively articulates the implications of the findings, addresses limitations, and compares results with existing literature.
