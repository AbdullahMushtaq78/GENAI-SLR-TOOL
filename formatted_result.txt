{'Overall_SLR_Score': '3.61/5', 'Overall_Summary': 'The systematic review collectively presents a thorough analysis of the association between gestational diabetes and neurodevelopmental disorders. The review scores well in areas of rationale, objectives, study selection, and synthesis methods but has noteworthy gaps in reporting bias assessments, data availability, and adherence to certain PRISMA checklist items. Feedback emphasizes the importance of clear criteria, structured frameworks, and transparency, particularly regarding data sharing and methodology.', 'Scores_per_agent': '5/5\n3/5\n4/5\n4/5\n4/5\n4/5\n4/5\n3/5\n4/5\n4/5\n5/5\n4/5\n4/5\n4/5\n3/5\n4/5\n2.33/5\n5/5\n5/5\n0/5', 'Feedback_per_agent': "The title effectively identifies the document as a systematic review and meta-analysis, clearly stating the focus on the association between gestational diabetes (GDM) and neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe abstract identifies the report as a systematic review and outlines the main objectives well. However, it lacks specific details about inclusion/exclusion criteria, the date of the last search, and methods for assessing risk of bias, among other important elements from the PRISMA checklist.\nThe rationale effectively describes the current state of research, emphasizes the significance of understanding GDM's specific effects on ASD and ADHD, identifies gaps in existing reviews, and outlines the complexities involved. However, it lacks a more explicit comparison with previous reviews and could benefit from a visual representation of the conceptual framework.\nThe objectives are clearly articulated and align with the review's scope and methods. However, the absence of a formal structured framework like PICO and the lack of differentiation between primary and secondary objectives are noted gaps that could enhance clarity.\nThe objectives section is clearly stated, addressing the specific aims of the review. Like the previous evaluation, it notes the implicit definition of elements without using a structured framework formally and lacks explicit distinctions between different objectives.\nThe eligibility criteria are well-defined and logically structured, but the absence of a specification regarding the minimum duration of follow-up could limit understanding of long-term impacts.\nWhile multiple databases were included, there was insufficient detail regarding the search platforms, specific searches per database, and additional online sources that could have been consulted.\nThe search strategy mentions several databases but lacks specific line-by-line search strategies and information regarding filters applied, limiting transparency and replicability.\nStudy selection was thorough, with independent reviewers and clear processes in place, although lacking mention of translation methods for non-English studies.\nThe data extraction process involved independent reviewers, enhancing credibility, but there is insufficient detail on how discrepancies were resolved and the tools employed for extraction.\nThe study selection process was thorough, following PRISMA guidelines and clearly documenting each step, resulting in a well-defined inclusion and exclusion process.\nThe included study characteristics were well reported, though some details on the population and study methodologies could have been more comprehensive.\nThe review provided a solid assessment of risk of bias for the included studies, highlighting potential issues, but could benefit from more detailed rationales for each assessment.\nIndividual study results were detailed, providing important metrics, but the presentation could be improved by including more effect estimates for studies that reported them.\nReporting bias assessments were noted, but the absence of funnel plots and explicit discussion on missing results limits the thoroughness of this evaluation.\nCertainty levels for evidence were well articulated, but further justification on the impacts of risk of bias and heterogeneity on findings could enhance clarity.\nThe registration with PROSPERO is adequately stated, but there is no access to a protocol document, and thereâ€™s a lack of information about any amendments made to the registration or protocol.\nThere is no reported financial or non-financial support which ensures transparency and independence in the review process.\nThe authors declared no competing interests, which contributes to the integrity and credibility of the findings.\nThe paper does not provide access to data, analytic code, or related materials, significantly lacking transparency and accessibility for reproducibility of findings."}
