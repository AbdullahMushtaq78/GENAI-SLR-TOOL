{'Overall_SLR_Score': '3.66/5', 'Overall_Summary': 'The systematic review demonstrates a solid foundation with clear objectives, rationale, and risk of bias assessments. However, there are significant gaps in the reporting of study characteristics, synthesis results, and data sharing, which hinder the overall clarity and utility of the review. Improvements in transparency, detailed methodologies, and accessibility of data would enhance the credibility and reliability of the findings. The review is well-structured in some areas, such as the discussion and risk of bias reporting, but requires further refinement in others, particularly in providing comprehensive tables, detailed statistical analyses, and addressing limitations related to the review process itself.', 'Scores_per_agent': '4/5\n4/5\n5/5\n4/5\n4/5\n4/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n4/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n3/5\n4/5', 'Feedback_per_agent': 'The title effectively communicates the main objective of the review and specifies the population involved, but the use of "systematic review" is not preferred.\nThe abstract provides a comprehensive overview of the systematic review, including objectives, methods, results, and limitations. However, it could be more concise.\nThe rationale is comprehensive and well-structured, addressing all essential items thoroughly. It provides a clear justification for the review, linking it to existing literature and highlighting its relevance. The inclusion of a logic model enhances understanding of the intervention\'s complexity.\nThe objectives are explicitly stated and framed within the PICO framework, enhancing clarity and focus. However, there could be more detail on the specific outcomes being measured to provide further clarity on the review\'s focus.\nThe objectives section is adequately addressed, with sufficient depth and clarity, but could benefit from additional detail regarding specific outcomes.\nThe eligibility criteria are well-defined and provide a clear framework for inclusion and exclusion, but lack explicit mention of minimum follow-up duration and the status of reports.\nInformation sources are mentioned, but details regarding specific platforms, coverage dates, and URLs are missing, limiting transparency.\nThe search strategy is partially detailed, lacking a complete line-by-line format for all databases and insufficient justification for limits applied.\nThe study selection process is transparent with independent screening and clear disagreement resolution, but lacks details on confirming information from study investigators.\nData collection methods are mentioned, but lack clarity on reviewer independence, disagreement resolution, and confirmation processes with study investigators.\nOutcome domains are identified but lack comprehensive definitions and prioritization, and the process for selecting results from multiple studies is not well-documented.\nThe use of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool is a positive aspect, but lacks detail on specific criteria and how disagreements were resolved.\nEffect measures are specified, but the documentation lacks clarity in presentation and rationale for interpretation thresholds.\nFunnel plots and protocol comparisons are mentioned, but lack detail on generation and interpretation, and reviewer involvement is not specified.\nThe GRADE system is used for certainty assessment, but lacks detail on specific criteria and how disagreements were resolved.\nSynthesis methods are mentioned but lack clarity on model choice, heterogeneity assessment, and handling of multiple effect estimates.\nThe study selection process was clearly outlined, detailing the number of records identified, screened, and included. However, there was a lack of transparency regarding the specific criteria used for exclusion, which could enhance clarity.\nThe reporting of study characteristics was minimally addressed. There was no comprehensive table summarizing the key characteristics of included studies, which is essential for comparison and understanding.\nThe risk of bias assessments were thoroughly reported, with a clear table summarizing the judgments across multiple domains. Justifications for each assessment were provided, enhancing transparency.\nIndividual study results were comprehensively reported, including summary statistics, effect estimates, and visual representations such as forest plots. This facilitates understanding and comparison across studies.\nThe synthesis results lacked clarity and detail. There was no explicit mention of statistical syntheses conducted, summary estimates, or measures of heterogeneity, which are crucial for interpreting results.\nThe assessment of risk of reporting bias was adequately addressed, with a funnel plot analysis indicating potential reporting bias. However, more detailed reporting on the implications of these findings would enhance clarity.\nThe certainty of evidence was assessed with varying levels for different outcomes. While the justifications for downgrading evidence were clear, a more detailed explanation of the implications of these ratings would be beneficial.\nThe discussion section effectively articulates the implications of the findings, addresses limitations, and compares results with existing literature. However, it could benefit from more detailed examples and a deeper exploration of contextual factors.\nThe systematic review is registered in PROSPERO, but lacks a specific citation or link to the protocol document, limiting accessibility. Amendments to the protocol are acknowledged but not fully detailed.\nThe funding source is clearly stated, including the role of the funder in the review\'s design and the absence of influence on data collection and analysis.\nCompeting interests are disclosed, and measures are taken to manage potential biases, although the involvement of two authors in related companies could raise concerns.\nNone of the relevant materials are publicly available, and access is restricted to case-by-case requests, which limits transparency and availability.'}
