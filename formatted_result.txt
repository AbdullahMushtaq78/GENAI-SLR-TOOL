{'Overall_SLR_Score': '3.6/5', 'Overall_Summary': "The systematic literature review on the role of AI in medical education and practice presents a comprehensive overview of the transformative potential of AI technologies. The review highlights innovative educational methodologies, such as virtual simulations and AI-driven diagnostic tools, which enhance clinical decision-making and foster personalized learning experiences. However, the review is limited by significant gaps in methodological rigor, including insufficient risk of bias assessments, lack of transparency in study selection, and inadequate reporting of the certainty of evidence. Future research should address these limitations by incorporating long-term impact assessments, ethical considerations, and broader inclusion of diverse methodologies. Additionally, the review's credibility is undermined by the absence of registration, protocol, and disclosure of competing interests, which restricts transparency and the ability for others to verify or build upon the findings.", 'Scores_per_agent': '4.5\n4\n3\n3.57\n4\n3\n3\n4\n3\n4\n3\n3\n4\n2', 'Feedback_per_agent': "The title is clear and informative, effectively summarizing the focus of the review. The abstract provides a good overview of the review's objectives but lacks specific details on methods, results, and limitations. Suggestions include specifying databases searched, outlining methods for assessing risk of bias, and providing details on the total number of participants.\nThe introduction offers a comprehensive overview of the integration of AI in medical education, articulating the necessity of the review. However, it could benefit from referencing existing systematic reviews and incorporating a visual logic model to clarify relationships between AI components and educational outcomes.\nThe literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of AI in medical education and practice, highlighting various studies and their findings. While the inclusion and exclusion criteria are well-defined, and the synthesis methods are adequately described, there are significant gaps in the data collection process, risk of bias assessment, and reporting bias evaluation. Addressing these weaknesses would enhance the rigor and transparency of the review.\nThe review provides a comprehensive overview of the study selection process, reporting the number of records identified, excluded, and included. However, it lacks a PRISMA flow diagram and does not cite studies that were excluded despite meeting initial criteria, limiting transparency. Additionally, there is no risk of bias assessment for the included studies.\nThe synthesis of results from the individual studies highlights various applications of AI in medical education and practice, showcasing innovative educational approaches and readiness among healthcare professionals. However, the limitations of the studies, such as reliance on self-reported measures and limited generalizability, should be more explicitly addressed.\nThe review does not adequately address reporting biases, lacking a risk of bias assessment, funnel plots, or sensitivity analyses. There is also insufficient reporting of the certainty of evidence, which diminishes the overall rigor of the review.\nThe systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical education and practice. The findings indicate that AI is significantly enhancing educational methodologies, improving clinical decision-making, and fostering personalized learning experiences for healthcare professionals. However, the review acknowledges limitations such as reliance on self-reported measures, lack of long-term follow-up, and potential biases, which affect the validity of the results. Future research should focus on addressing these gaps.\nThe review did not report any registration, protocol, or sources of support, which limits its transparency and credibility. The absence of disclosed competing interests and publicly available materials restricts the ability for others to verify or build upon the findings. Future systematic literature reviews should prioritize registration and protocol preparation to enhance transparency and ethical standards."}
