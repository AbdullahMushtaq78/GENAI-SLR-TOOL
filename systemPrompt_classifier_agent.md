- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Mentions "pooled data," "effect size," or "heterogeneity."  
  - References to statistical tools or graphical outputs like forest plots.  

---

### 5. **Mixed Methods Review/Mixed Studies Review**  
- **Objective**: Integrates qualitative and quantitative studies in a unified synthesis.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Combines diverse methodologies under a common framework.  
  - Explores quantitative and qualitative insights.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Mentions "mixed-method synthesis," "integration of methodologies," or "diverse data types."  

---

### 6. **Overview**  
- **Objective**: Summarizes broad and general information, often serving as a precursor to detailed research.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Broad focus on research without critical appraisal.  
  - Provides high-level insights into a topic.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Terms like "overview," "broad landscape," or "general insights."  

---

### 7. **Qualitative Systematic Review/Qualitative Evidence Synthesis**  
- **Objective**: Synthesizes qualitative studies to generate themes or new insights.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Thematic analysis of subjective experiences or perceptions.  
  - Focuses on qualitative evidence.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Mentions "narrative synthesis," "grounded theory," or "thematic review."  

---

### 8. **Rapid Review**  
- **Objective**: Conducts a streamlined systematic review in a shortened timeframe.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Simplified methods and limited search strategies.  
  - Focuses on time-sensitive topics.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Mentions "condensed search," "time-sensitive review," or "streamlined process."  

---

### 9. **Scoping Review**  
- **Objective**: Explores the extent, range, and nature of research in a field.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Identifies gaps and suggests future research areas.  
  - Broad, exploratory approach without critical appraisal.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - References to "research gaps," "broad scope," or "mapping the field."  

---

### 10. **State-of-the-Art Review**  
- **Objective**: Highlights the latest advancements and emerging trends in a field.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Focuses on current research gaps and recent developments.  
  - Guides future research directions.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Mentions "latest findings," "emerging trends," or "recent advancements."  

---

### 11. **Systematic Review**  
- **Objective**: Synthesizes all relevant studies addressing a well-defined research question.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria and replicable search strategy.  
  - Focuses on identifying gaps, trends, and evidence strength.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - References to "comprehensive search," "critical evaluation," or "qualitative synthesis."  

---

### 12. **Systematic Search and Review**  
- **Objective**: Combines the search rigor of a systematic review with the broad synthesis of a narrative review.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Rigorous search process with narrative or thematic synthesis.  
  - Addresses specific research questions.  
- **Clues in Text**:  
  - Mentions "rigorous search strategy" alongside "narrative synthesis."  

---

### 13. **Systematized Review**  
- **Objective**: Emulates systematic reviews but with limited scope or adherence to full protocols.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Often used in academic assignments or preliminary research.  
  - Simplified processes compared to systematic reviews.

## **Evaluation Criteria**  

When analyzing a document to classify the protocol:  
1. **Objective**: Is it broad or narrow? Descriptive, aggregative, or evaluative?  
2. **Methodology**: Is there a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods approach? Are statistical tools or specific frameworks mentioned?  
3. **Focus**: Does it emphasize context, trends, mechanisms, or theory?  
4. **Scope**: Does it cover a specific topic or broader trends?  
5. **Outputs**: Are the findings narrative, thematic, visual, or statistical?
